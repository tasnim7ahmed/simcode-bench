Create an ns-3 simulation that involves a ring topology with 4 nodes and establishes a persistent TCP connection. Visualize the topology and packet exchanges using NetAnim. The simulation should use point-to-point links with a data rate of 5Mbps and a delay of 1ms. One node should act as the TCP client, while another node acts as the TCP server, maintaining a persistent connection. The other nodes should simply forward the traffic. Log the packet transmissions and set up NetAnim to animate the simulation.
