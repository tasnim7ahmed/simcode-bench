Write a C++ program using the NS-3 library to simulate a network topology with three nodes, where n1 and n3 are connected to n2 through point-to-point links. Configure the access link between n1 and n2 with 100 Mbps bandwidth and 0.1 ms delay, while the bottleneck link between n2 and n3 has adjustable bandwidth and delay parameters. Implement several queue disc types, including PfifoFast, ARED, CoDel, FqCoDel, and PIE, for traffic control on the bottleneck link, and allow the option to enable Byte Queue Limits (BQL). Generate bidirectional TCP flows between n1 and n3, and monitor the goodput. Additionally, n1 should ping n3 to measure RTT. Output trace files for queue limits, bytes in the queue, goodput, and flow statistics.
