Create a C++ program using ns-3 that generates a dataset of packet transmissions between nodes in a network. The program should simulate a wireless network with 5 nodes, where each node sends UDP traffic to a central server (node 4). The dataset should record the source node, destination node, packet size, transmission time, and reception time for each packet, and write this information into a CSV file.
