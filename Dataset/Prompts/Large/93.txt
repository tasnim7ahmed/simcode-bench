Generate a C++ program using the ns-3 library that simulates a basic LAN topology with two nodes (n0 and n1) connected via a CSMA link. The program should establish a UDP communication between the two nodes, with node n0 sending packets to node n1. The sender should have options to set IP_TOS and IP_TTL values for the packets, while the receiver should log received packets along with their TOS and TTL values. Include command-line parameters to configure packet size, number of packets, packet interval, and socket options such as TOS, TTL, RECVTOS, and RECVTTL.
