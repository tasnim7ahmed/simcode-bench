Generate a C++ program using the ns-3 library to simulate a simple network topology with four nodes connected via a CSMA LAN. The program should establish a UDP echo server on node 1 and a UDP echo client on node 0, which sends datagrams to node 1 and receives responses. Set DropTail queues for the LAN and configure tracing of queue and packet reception events. The simulation should run in real-time mode, log tracing information to a file named "udp-echo.tr", and also generate pcap traces.
