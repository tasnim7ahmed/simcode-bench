Generate a C++ program using ns-3 to simulate a simple Poisson Reverse setup. The program should create a point-to-point network between two nodes and utilize the Poisson Reverse method for dynamic routing. Implement a minimal routing protocol that periodically updates route costs based on the inverse of the distance to the destination. The program should also include logging of route updates and simulation statistics. Ensure that traffic flows between the nodes and that the Poisson Reverse logic is applied to adjust routes dynamically.
