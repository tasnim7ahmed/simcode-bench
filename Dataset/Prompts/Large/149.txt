Create a C++ program using ns-3 to simulate a line topology with 3 nodes. Node 0 connects to node 1, and node 1 connects to node 2 via point-to-point links. Configure UDP traffic where node 0 sends traffic to node 2 through node 1. Assign IP addresses to each network segment, and enable PCAP tracing to capture traffic. The simulation should run for 10 seconds.
