Write a C++ program using ns-3 to simulate a network with three nodes connected by point-to-point links with 10 Mbps bandwidth and 10 ms delay between n0, n1, and n2. Install a PacketSinkApplication on node n2 to receive data sent over TCP from node n0. Use a socket to implement the sender directly at node n0. Set the simulation to send 2,000,000 bytes and track the congestion window using a callback. Enable tracing of queues and packet receptions, saving traces in an ASCII file 'tcp-large-transfer.tr' and generating pcap files named 'tcp-large-transfer-$n-$i.pcap'.
