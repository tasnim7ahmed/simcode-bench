Write a C++ script using the ns-3 simulation library to simulate a point-to-point network topology with four nodes. The topology should include three point-to-point links: n0 to n2 and n1 to n2 with a bandwidth of 5 Mbps and delay of 2 ms, and n2 to n3 with a bandwidth of 1.5 Mbps and delay of 10 ms. Set up CBR/UDP traffic from n0 to n3 and n3 to n1, using a packet size of 210 bytes and a data rate of 448 kbps. Additionally, set up an FTP/TCP flow from n0 to n3 starting at 1.2 seconds and ending at 1.35 seconds. Use DropTail queues and enable tracing to a file called 'simple-global-routing.tr'.
