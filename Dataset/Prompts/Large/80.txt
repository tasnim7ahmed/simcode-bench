Generate a C++ program using ns-3 that sets up a point-to-point network with two nodes and demonstrates the usage of the Token Bucket Filter (TBF) queue discipline. The program should allow configuration of the TBF parameters, including the size of the first and second buckets, the token arrival rate, and the peak rate via command-line arguments. Implement tracing for the number of tokens in both buckets during the simulation. The simulation should also include a basic OnOff traffic generator sending packets between the nodes, and output the TBF queue statistics at the end of the simulation.
