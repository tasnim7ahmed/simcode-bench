Write a script in ns-3 that sets up a wireless network with three nodes operating on an 802.11b physical layer, where one node is a transmitter, another a receiver, and the third an interferer. The transmitter sends a packet to the receiver with a configurable RSS (defaulting to -80 dBm), while the interferer also sends a packet without carrier sense, interfering with the primary packet. Configurable parameters include primary and interfering RSS, the time offset between the primary and interfering signals, and packet sizes for both transmissions. The script should allow the user to enable verbose Wi-Fi logging and produce a pcap trace file for analysis.
