Create a simple simulation of an IEEE 802.11n Wi-Fi network using ns-3 with the ability to test different Wi-Fi PHY models like SpectrumWifiPhy and YansWifiPhy, configure various parameters such as simulation time, distance between nodes, and modulation and coding scheme (MCS) index, and log signal and noise information. It should also explain how to toggle between UDP and TCP traffic, capture packets if needed, and iterate through different MCS, channel widths, and guard intervals, reporting throughput, signal strength, noise, and SNR for each configuration.
