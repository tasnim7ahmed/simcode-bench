Simulate a wireless sensor network (WSN) in ns-3 with six sensor nodes placed in a grid. The nodes should communicate using a simple CSMA protocol. One of the nodes should act as a base station, receiving data from the other sensor nodes using a UDP protocol. The sensor nodes should periodically send data to the base station. Collect and display metrics such as packet delivery ratio and end-to-end delay, and visualize the communication using NetAnim.
