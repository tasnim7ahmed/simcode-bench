Write a simple C++ program using the ns-3 simulation library to set up a mesh topology with three nodes. Configure the nodes to communicate using a Wi-Fi mesh network and assign them static positions. Use UDP traffic to generate communication between the nodes. The simulation should run for 10 seconds, and it should output basic statistics such as packet transmission and reception. Additionally, enable PCAP tracing to capture the packet flow for analysis.
