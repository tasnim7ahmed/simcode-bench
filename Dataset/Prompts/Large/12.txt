Generate a C++ program using the NS-3 simulation framework to simulate a network topology with two nodes (n0 and n1) connected via a CSMA LAN. The program should simulate a UDP flow from node n0 to node n1, where the client on n0 sends packets based on the data read from a trace file. The user should be able to select between IPv4 and IPv6 addressing via command-line arguments and also have the option to enable or disable logging statements. When logging is enabled, it should provide detailed logs for both the UDP client and server. Configure the CSMA channel with a data rate of 5 Mbps, a delay of 2 ms, and an MTU of 1500 bytes. The UDP server should run on port 4000 and be installed on node n1, starting at 1 second and stopping at 10 seconds. The UDP client should back off 28 bytes (20 for IP and 8 for UDP) from the MTU to set the maximum packet size at 1472 bytes and start sending packets at 2 seconds, stopping at 10 seconds. Use the required NS-3 modules (applications, core, csma, and internet), and ensure the program runs with appropriate logging and simulation outputs.
