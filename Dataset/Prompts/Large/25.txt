Generate a code that configures and simulates an IEEE 802.11ax Wi-Fi network using the NS-3 simulator to analyze UDP or TCP traffic performance under varying Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) values, channel widths, and guard intervals. It sets up an access point (AP) and one or more stations, allowing you to customize parameters such as the distance between the AP and stations, the acknowledgment sequence for downlink (DL) MU PPDUs, and options like enabling RTS/CTS, 80+80 MHz channels, extended block acknowledgment, or UL OFDMA. You can simulate 2.4, 5, or 6 GHz bands with Yans or Spectrum PHY models. The code lets you adjust the number of stations, packet payload size, and target throughput. Depending on your choice, it initializes UDP or TCP flows and produces throughput results for different MCS values and channel widths. You can also schedule channel access and assess network performance across various configurations and topologies.
