Simulate a simple wireless network using ns-3, comprising three nodes arranged in a line topology. Configure the middle node as a router that forwards packets between the two end nodes. Implement a Constant Bit Rate (CBR) traffic source on one end node and a packet sink on the other to measure end-to-end throughput. Enable tracing to capture packet transmissions and receptions, and output the results to a file for analysis.
