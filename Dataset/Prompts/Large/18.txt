Generate a code in NS-3 that simulates a wireless network using WifiHelper and MobilityHelper where two stations (stas) communicate with an access point (ap). Install packet socket capabilities on the nodes, configure the wifi settings with StaWifiMac for stations and ApWifiMac for the access point using the same SSID, and set up mobility for both stations and the access point. Include tracing for MAC and PHY-level events such as TX, RX, PHY RX OK, PHY RX error, and state transitions, and use a helper function to move the access point along the x-axis by 5 meters every second. The stations should communicate with a data rate of 500kbps, and the simulation should run for 44 seconds, starting the communication after 0.5 seconds.
