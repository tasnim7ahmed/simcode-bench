Write a C++ program using the ns-3 simulation library that tests the creation of IPv6 addresses by autoconfiguring them from a set of MAC addresses. Initialize an array of 10 MAC addresses and set them to specific values. Use two different IPv6 prefixes, '2001:1::' and '2002:1:1::', and for each prefix, generate an autoconfigured IPv6 address for each MAC address in the array. Log the process, displaying the prefix and each corresponding generated IPv6 address in the console. Ensure to include the necessary ns-3 headers and set up logging for the program.
