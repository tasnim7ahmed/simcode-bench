Generate a C++ program using ns-3 to simulate a UDP Echo Client and Server between three nodes. Set up two point-to-point connections: one between the first and second nodes, and another between the second and third nodes. Both links should have a data rate of 5Mbps and a delay of 2ms. The client on the first node should send UDP packets to the server on the third node, with the second node acting as a router. The simulation should log packet transmission and reception, and the IP address configuration should reflect proper routing between the nodes.
