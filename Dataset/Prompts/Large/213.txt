Simulate a simple TCP connection over a point-to-point link between two nodes in ns-3. The simulation will involve two nodes, one acting as a TCP server and the other as a TCP client. The client will send data to the server using TCP, and the simulation will record the number of bytes successfully transmitted and received. Additionally, enable packet tracing to observe the packet-level behavior of TCP during the simulation.
