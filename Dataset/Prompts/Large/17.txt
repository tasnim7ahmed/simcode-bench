Generate NS-3 code that sets up a Wi-Fi network simulation with four independent networks, each consisting of one access point and one station working on different channels (36, 40, 44, 48). Configure each station to continuously transmit data packets to its respective AP with varying aggregation settings: station A should use default aggregation with A-MSDU disabled and A-MPDU enabled at 65 KB, station B should have both A-MPDU and A-MSDU disabled, station C should enable A-MSDU with 8 KB and disable A-MPDU, and station D should use two-level aggregation with A-MPDU at 32 KB and A-MSDU at 4 KB. Include command line options to modify payload size, simulation time, distance between stations and APs, and enable or disable RTS/CTS.
