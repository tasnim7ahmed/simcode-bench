Write a C++ code that uses the ns-3 network simulator to demonstrate the use of TrafficControlHelper for installing a RedQueueDisc on a point-to-point link between two nodes. The simulation should track and print statistics about the queue lengths at the traffic control and device layers, as well as the sojourn time of packets. Additionally, configure TCP as the transport protocol, simulate packet transmission, and report flow statistics such as throughput, mean delay, and jitter using FlowMonitor.
