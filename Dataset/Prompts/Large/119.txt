Create a C++ program using the ns-3 simulation library to set up an ad hoc wireless network with six nodes. Configure these nodes to operate in ad hoc mode using IEEE 802.11 and implement a grid mobility model that arranges them in a grid layout while allowing for random movement within a specified rectangular area. Install the Internet stack on each node and assign them IPv4 addresses from the 192.9.39.0/24 subnet. Establish UDP echo server applications on each node to facilitate communication in a ring topology where each node sends echo requests to the next. Limit each client to a maximum of 20 packets sent at half-second intervals. Integrate a flow monitor to collect statistics, including packet delivery ratios, end-to-end delays, and throughput for all communications. Generate an animation file to visualize the network activity during the simulation. After running the simulation, output the flow statistics and performance metrics to the console.
