Create a C++ program using the ns-3 simulator to compare the performance of different MANET routing protocols (DSDV, AODV, OLSR, and DSR) under a typical random waypoint mobility model. The default simulation runs for 200 seconds with 50 nodes moving at 20 m/s in a 300x1500 meter area, using WiFi in ad-hoc mode with a transmission power of 7.5 dBm. The program allows modifying parameters such as protocol choice, node density, mobility, and transmission power. Additionally, it generates 10 UDP source/sink pairs with data transmission starting randomly between 50 and 51 seconds. The simulation outputs data reception statistics in a CSV file, with optional mobility tracing and flow monitoring.
