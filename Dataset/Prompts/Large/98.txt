Generate a C++ program using ns-3 that simulates global routing in a mixed point-to-point and CSMA/CD network. Set up a network with seven nodes, including both point-to-point and CSMA links. Implement two separate CBR/UDP traffic flows from node 1 to node 6, with the first starting on the point-to-point link at 1 second and the second at 11 seconds using the alternative point-to-point link. Simulate interface down and up events at various times, causing rerouting of traffic via alternative paths. Enable automatic response to interface events for global route recomputation, and trace packet receptions and queue activity to output files.
