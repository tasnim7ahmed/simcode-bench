Create a C++ simulation using ns-3 to simulate a ring topology with 3 nodes. The nodes are interconnected in a ring, and point-to-point links are used between adjacent nodes. Set the link data rate to 10Mbps and delay to 2ms. Install basic Internet stack, assign IP addresses, and simulate packet transmission between the nodes in the ring. Use logging to track packet transmissions.
