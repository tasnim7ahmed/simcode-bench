Provide code that validates NIST, YANS, and Table-based error rate models for HT (High Throughput) rates in NS-3. The program should generate Gnuplot plots of Frame Success Rate versus Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) for each error rate model and for every HT MCS value. It should iterate over SNR values, calculate the frame success rate for each mode and model, and output the results as Gnuplot datasets while allowing configuration of frame size.
