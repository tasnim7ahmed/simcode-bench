Create a C++ program using the ns-3 simulation library to model an ad hoc wireless network with two nodes. Configure the nodes to use an IEEE 802.11 protocol with ad hoc mode, set up a mobility model that allows nodes to randomly walk within specified bounds, and install the Internet stack on both nodes. Assign IPv4 addresses and implement a UDP echo server on one node and a corresponding client on the other to exchange packets. Utilize the Flow Monitor to collect statistics such as packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay, and throughput. Additionally, generate an animation file to visualize the network. Ensure to log detailed statistics for the simulation's performance analysis and output the results after the simulation concludes.
