Generate a complete NS-3 simulation code that models a TCP pacing scenario using a specific network topology, derived from a real-world example. The topology includes six nodes interconnected with varying bandwidths and delays, including a bottleneck link with a TCP flow crossing from node n2 to n3. Enable TCP pacing on the sockets, configure the initial congestion window, and trace various TCP metrics such as congestion window size, pacing rate, and packet transmission/reception times. Ensure to include command-line options for configuring pacing, simulation time, and other relevant TCP parameters. At the end of the simulation, print flow statistics and generate data files that track changes in these metrics.
