Create an ns-3 simulation with a star topology consisting of five nodes. The central node acts as a hub that connects to four peripheral nodes through point-to-point links, each with a data rate of 10 Mbps and a delay of 1 ms. Install a UDP echo server on the central node and configure UDP echo clients on each of the peripheral nodes to send packets to the central node. Collect metrics using FlowMonitor, including packet delivery ratio, delay, and throughput, and log them. Additionally, enable pcap tracing for analysis and simulate for 10 seconds.
