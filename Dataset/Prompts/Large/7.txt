Create a ring topology network using ns3 where four nodes are connected in a circular manner with point-to-point links between adjacent nodes. Assign IP addresses within the 192.9.39.0/24 network, and use the UDP Echo Client-Server application for communication. Each node should act as both a client and a server at least once, but only one pair of client-server applications should run at any given time. Ensure that each client sends exactly 4 packets, with a transmission interval of 1 second, and configure the server to respond to the client's requests. Additionally, configure the link data rate to 5Mbps and a delay of 2ms.
