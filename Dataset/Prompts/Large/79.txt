Write a C++ program using the ns-3 simulation library to create a network topology with four nodes: n0, n1, n2, and n3. In this topology, n0 and n1 connect to n2 via point-to-point links with 5 Mbps bandwidth and 2 ms delay, while n1 and n3 are also connected via a higher-cost point-to-point link with 1.5 Mbps bandwidth and 100 ms delay. An alternate path exists between n2 and n3, which has a delay of 10 ms and 1.5 Mbps bandwidth. Set a configurable metric between n1 and n3, allowing for rerouting behavior. Enable tracing of queues and packet receptions to a file, and use UDP traffic from n3 to n1, logging simulation results.
