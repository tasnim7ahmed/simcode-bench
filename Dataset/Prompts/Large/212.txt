Simulate a wireless ad-hoc network using the AODV (Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector) routing protocol in ns-3. The network consists of 5 nodes, all of which are randomly placed in a 100x100 meter area. UDP traffic will be sent from one node to another, and the simulation will track the packet transmission, route discovery, and delivery using the AODV protocol. Pcap traces will also be enabled for further analysis.
