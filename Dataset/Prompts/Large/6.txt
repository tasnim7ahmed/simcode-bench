Write a C++ program using NS-3 to simulate a basic Wi-Fi network consisting of three nodes: one acting as an access point (AP) and the other two as Wi-Fi stations (STAs). The stations should communicate with each other through the AP. Set up an IPv4 network and assign IP addresses to all nodes. Implement a UDP echo protocol where one station acts as a client and the other as a server. The client should send a 512-byte message to the server. Capture network traffic in a .pcap file. The simulation should run for 20 seconds, with the UDP server starting at 1 second and the client starting at 2 seconds. Ensure the simulation ends after all messages are exchanged.
