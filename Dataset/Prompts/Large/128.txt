Generate a C++ program using NS-3 to simulate a network where routers exchange Link State Advertisements (LSAs) as part of Link State Routing. Create a topology with four routers connected via point-to-point links, where OSPF is used for route discovery and link state updates. Simulate the transmission of LSAs between the routers as network changes occur, and visualize the LSA process using pcap tracing. Also, generate traffic from one node to another to observe how link state routing adapts.
