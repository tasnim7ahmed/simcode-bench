Generate a simulation code in ns-3 to compare the performance of mesh and tree topologies. In the simulation, create a mesh network with 4 nodes and a tree network with 4 nodes. Use UDP traffic applications for both topologies, and measure key performance metrics such as throughput, latency, and packet delivery ratio. Use FlowMonitor to capture statistics and visualize the topologies with NetAnim. Ensure the simulation runs for 20 seconds, and output the final results comparing the two topologies. Animate the node movements and traffic using NetAnim.
