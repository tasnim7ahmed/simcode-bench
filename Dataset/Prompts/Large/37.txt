Create a C++ program using the ns-3 network simulator to compare three WiFi rate control mechanisms: `ParfWifiManager`, `AparfWifiManager`, and `RrpaaWifiManager`. The program should simulate a simple WiFi network consisting of two nodes: an access point (AP) and a station (STA). The AP should generate UDP traffic at a constant bit rate (CBR) of 54 Mbps towards the STA. The STA will move away from the AP by 1 meter every second, and you should log the changes in transmit power and rate, as well as plot average throughput and average transmit power as functions of distance. Your program should output Gnuplot-compatible files and allow the user to specify parameters such as the rate control mechanism, RTS threshold, and output filenames through command-line arguments.
