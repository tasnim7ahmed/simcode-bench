Generate a complete NS-3 simulation example that demonstrates the use of the 802.11n compressed block acknowledgment mechanism. Create a network topology with an access point and two stations, where a QoS station sends UDP packets to the access point, which replies with ICMP frames. Configure the block acknowledgment parameters, including setting a block acknowledgment threshold and a timeout for block acknowledgment inactivity. Implement the necessary NS-3 classes, such as YansWifiChannelHelper, YansWifiPhyHelper, WifiHelper, and others, to create nodes, install devices, and set up mobility models. Also, set up the Internet stack and routing tables, and define applications for packet transmission with specified data rates and timing attributes. Finally, enable packet capture for the access point and run the simulation.
