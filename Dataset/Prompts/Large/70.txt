Generate a C++ program using ns-3 that sets up a dumbbell network topology with configurable leaf nodes and queue types, supporting either RED or NLRED queue disciplines. The program should accept command-line arguments to adjust settings such as the number of leaf nodes, queue disc limits, packet size, data rates, and RED queue thresholds. Implement the ability to toggle between packet-based and byte-based queue modes. The OnOff application should be installed on right-side nodes, with random On/Off periods, and the program should display statistics about packet drops in the queue. Ensure appropriate handling of errors and conditions in the queue disc statistics.
