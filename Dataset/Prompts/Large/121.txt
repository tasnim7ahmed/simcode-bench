Write a C++ program using the ns-3 simulation library to model a disaster recovery network consisting of a central command node, three medical units, and three teams of responders, each with five nodes. Implement a WiFi ad hoc network where the teams have random mobility while the medical units and the central command remain stationary. Configure the nodes with appropriate IP addresses and enable RTS/CTS for improved performance. Set up a UDP echo server for each team and corresponding clients to send packets every two seconds. Integrate a flow monitor to capture statistics such as packet delivery ratios, end-to-end delays, and throughput, and output these metrics after the simulation. Additionally, create an animation file to visualize the network activity during the simulation.
