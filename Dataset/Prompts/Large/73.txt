Write a C++ program using the ns-3 simulator that sets up a three-router network topology where routers A, B, and C are interconnected by point-to-point links. The topology is as follows: router A has an IP address in the range a.a.a.a/32, router B connects A and C over subnet x.x.x.0/30 and y.y.y.0/30, and router C has an IP address in the range c.c.c.c/32. Install an OnOff UDP application on router A to send datagrams to router C, and set up a packet sink on router C to receive the traffic. Use the Ipv4GlobalRoutingHelper to populate routing tables, configure packet tracing, and run the simulation for 10 seconds.
