Generate a C++ program using NS-3 to simulate a small network running Link State Routing. Create a topology of four routers connected by point-to-point links, where OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) is used to simulate Link State Routing. The program should allow dynamic route discovery using the OSPF protocol, include traffic generation from one end of the network to another, and generate pcap tracing files to observe routing behavior and data traffic.
