Generate a C++ program using the ns3 library to simulate a ring topology network. The network should consist of four nodes, where each node is connected to two other nodes, forming a ring. Use the UDP echo client-server application to simulate communication between the nodes. Each node should act as both a client and a server at least once, with only one pair of client-server applications running at a time. The clients should send a maximum of 4 packets with a defined transmission interval, and all packets should be successfully received by the respective server. Set the network address to 192.9.39.0/24, and use point-to-point links with a 5Mbps data rate and 2ms delay for the connections. Include necessary logging and NetAnim visualization for the simulation
