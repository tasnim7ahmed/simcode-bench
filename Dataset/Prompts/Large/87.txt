Generate C++ code for an ns-3 simulation experiment that measures Wi-Fi performance based on the distance between two nodes. The program should include Wi-Fi configuration using Ad-hoc mode, mobility for node placement, and statistics collection such as packet transmission, reception, and delay tracking. Use the `DataCollector` class to gather experiment data and support both OMNeT and SQLite output formats. Create callbacks for packet transmission and reception, and define command-line arguments for experiment configuration, including distance, format, and run identifiers.
