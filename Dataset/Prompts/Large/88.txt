Generate C++ code for an ns-3 simulation that demonstrates energy consumption in a Wi-Fi network with two nodes. Configure nodes with basic energy sources and Wi-Fi radio energy models, and simulate packet transmission between them. Include functionality to track remaining energy and total energy consumed by the nodes, using trace sources. Use the UDP protocol to send and receive packets, and log the transmission details. Allow command-line configuration of parameters such as packet size, simulation start time, and node distance. Ensure the energy consumed remains within specified limits by the end of the simulation.
