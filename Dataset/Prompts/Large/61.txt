Generate code that creates a network topology with four nodes (n0, n1, n2, and n3) connected in a series, where n0 to n1 has a 10 Mbps link with 1 ms delay, n1 to n2 has a 1 Mbps link with 10 ms delay, and n2 to n3 has a 10 Mbps link with 1 ms delay. Implement a TCP flow from n0 to n3 using the BulkSendApplication. Store simulation output in the "results/" directory, including cwnd traces in "cwndTraces", queue length statistics in "queue-size.dat", PCAP files in "pcap", queue drop statistics in "queueTraces", and queue stats in "queueStats.txt". Include configuration details in "config.txt".
