Create a simulation in ns-3 to compare the performance of TCP and UDP traffic in a simple network topology. Use a point-to-point topology with two nodes. Install both TCP and UDP applications on the network, transmitting data between the nodes. Measure and compare the key performance metrics, including throughput, latency, and packet delivery ratio for each protocol. Use FlowMonitor to capture and analyze these metrics, and visualize the traffic and node movements using NetAnim. Ensure that the simulation runs for 10 seconds, and print out the performance results for comparison between TCP and UDP.
