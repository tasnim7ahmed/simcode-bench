Write a C++ program using the ns-3 simulator to demonstrate 802.11n aggregation across four independent Wi-Fi networks, each operating on a different channel (36, 40, 44, and 48) with one access point (AP) and one station (STA) per network. Configure different aggregation settings for each station: station A uses default A-MPDU with a max size of 65kB, station B disables aggregation, station C enables A-MSDU with a max size of 8kB but disables A-MPDU, and station D enables both A-MPDU with a max size of 32kB and A-MSDU with 4kB. Include options for adjusting distance between the AP and STA, enabling/disabling RTS/CTS, and modifying TXOP durations, then output the throughput and maximum TXOP duration for each network. Use the YansWifiPhy, YansWifiChannel, and mobility models to set up the simulation, and trace TXOP durations for each access point using callbacks.
