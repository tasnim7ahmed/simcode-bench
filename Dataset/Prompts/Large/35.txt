Create a simulation for a wireless network that validates NIST, YANS, and Table-based error rate models for OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing) rates in NS-3. The program should iterate over different OFDM modes and compute the Frame Success Rate versus Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) for each error rate model. The program should output plots using Gnuplot, with each OFDM mode represented as a separate dataset. Frame size should be configurable through command-line arguments, and the SNR range should be from -5 dB to 30 dB.
