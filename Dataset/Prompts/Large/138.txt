Generate a C++ program using ns-3 to simulate a UDP Echo Client and Server for four nodes. Set up three point-to-point links: one between node 0 and node 1, another between node 1 and node 2, and a third between node 2 and node 3. All links should have a data rate of 5Mbps and a delay of 2ms. The client on node 0 should send UDP packets to the server on node 3, with nodes 1 and 2 acting as routers. Ensure proper routing and log packet transmission and reception during the simulation.
