Create a C++ simulation using ns-3 to simulate a tree topology with 4 nodes. In this configuration, one root node connects to two child nodes, and one of the child nodes connects to a leaf node. Use point-to-point links with a data rate of 5Mbps and a delay of 2ms. Install the Internet stack, assign IP addresses, and simulate packet transmission from the leaf node to the root node. Use logging to track packet transmissions.
