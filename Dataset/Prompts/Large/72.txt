Write a C++ program using the ns-3 simulator that creates a network topology with two L2 LANs, each with multiple interconnected L2 switches, connected by a WAN link. Name the two LANs "top" (192.168.1/24) and "bottom" (192.168.2/24), and assign each LAN its own router to act as a gateway to the WAN. Configure UDP echo clients and servers on both LANs to test connectivity. In the top LAN, connect node t2 (UDP echo client) through multiple switches to router tr, and node t3 (UDP echo server) through a single switch. In the bottom LAN, connect node b2 (UDP echo server) through multiple switches to router br, and node b3 (UDP echo client) through a single switch. Ensure the simulation can use both 100Mbit and 10Mbit Ethernet CSMA links for LAN connections, configurable via command-line arguments, and model the WAN using a point-to-point link with configurable rate and delay. Use this to test a patch that fixes global-router-interface support for bridging across multiple switches
