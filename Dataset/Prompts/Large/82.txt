Write a C++ program using the ns-3 network simulator to create a local area network (LAN) connecting four nodes. Implement UDP communication where node n0 sends and receives UDP packets to and from node n1 using UdpEchoServer and UdpEchoClient applications. Configure a DropTail queue on the network and enable tracing of queue lengths and packet receptions, saving the results to a file named "udp-echo.tr." Simulate this setup for 10 seconds, using either IPv4 or IPv6, based on user input.
