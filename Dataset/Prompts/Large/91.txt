Generate a complete NS-3 simulation program for a multi-interface host with static routing. The network should include a source node, a destination node, and two routers, with two routes connecting the source to the destination through the routers. Configure the routes with different metrics to influence traffic routing. Ensure that the program sends UDP packets from the source to the destination, dynamically binding the socket to different interfaces on the source node. Additionally, implement callback functions to handle packet reception at both the source and destination, and log details of each received packet.
