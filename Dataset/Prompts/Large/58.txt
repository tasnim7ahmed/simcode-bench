Write a C++ program using ns-3 to simulate a network with four nodes: a sender, two routers (R1 and R2), and a receiver. Create three point-to-point links: sender to R1 and R2 to receiver with 1000 Mbps bandwidth and 5ms delay, and a bottleneck link between R1 and R2 with 10 Mbps bandwidth and 10ms delay. Set the simulation to run for 100 seconds, and configure the TCP BBR congestion control algorithm on the sender. Enable pcap tracing on all interfaces, save congestion window traces, sender throughput traces, and queue size traces from the bottleneck link to output files. Ensure the BBR algorithm enters the PROBE_RTT phase every 10 seconds, reducing the congestion window to 4 segments.
