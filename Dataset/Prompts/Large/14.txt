Generate C++ code using ns-3 that demonstrates the setup of a Wi-Fi network with QoS for different access categories (AC). The code should define 4 independent Wi-Fi networks, each consisting of one access point (AP) and one station (STA), operating on different logical channels of the same physical medium. Each STA sends data packets to its respective AP using different QoS settings for AC_BE and AC_VI. The user should be able to configure parameters such as payload size, distance between nodes, RTS/CTS settings, and simulation time. The code should trace the TXOP duration for each QoS configuration and output the measured throughput. Include application setup using UdpServer and OnOffHelper for traffic generation, mobility models for positioning nodes, and the InternetStackHelper for IP addressing. Add command-line support to customize parameters and allow enabling or disabling of pcap file generation. The simulation should stop after the configured time, and the throughput and TXOP duration results should be printed.
