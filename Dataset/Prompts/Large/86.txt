Generate C++ code implementing a basic Wi-Fi sender and receiver application using the ns-3 simulator. The sender transmits a defined number of packets at regular intervals, while the receiver listens for these packets, calculates statistics like delay, and logs relevant information. The sender should utilize attributes such as packet size, destination address, port, and interval. The receiver should have attributes like the listening port and must handle incoming packets by tracing timestamps to calculate the delay. Both sender and receiver must be derived from the `Application` class and include necessary ns-3 modules.
