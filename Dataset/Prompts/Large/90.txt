Generate a C++ script for an NS-3 network simulation where the topology consists of four nodes: n0, n1, n2, and n3. Nodes n0 and n1 are connected to n2 with point-to-point links (5 Mbps, 2 ms delay), and n3 is connected to n2 with a point-to-point link (1.5 Mbps, 10 ms delay). There are two CBR/UDP flows: one from n0 to n3 and another from n3 to n1. Additionally, an FTP/TCP flow runs from n0 to n3, starting at 1.2 seconds and stopping at 1.35 seconds. The UDP packet size is 210 bytes, with a transmission interval of 0.00375 seconds, resulting in a data rate of 448 Kbps. Implement DropTail queues, and trace both queue behaviors and packet receptions to the file 'simple-error-model.tr'. Add error models: a rate error model with a 0.001 packet error rate and a burst error model with a 0.01 error rate, along with a list error model that drops packets with UIDs 11 and 17
