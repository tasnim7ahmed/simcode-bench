Generate an NS-3 C++ simulation script for a CSMA (Ethernet) wired network with four nodes. The nodes should be connected using a CSMA channel with a data rate of 100 Mbps and a propagation delay of 6560 nanoseconds. Each node should have a unique IPv4 address in the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet. The last node should run a UDP echo server on port 9, while the first node acts as a client sending five packets of 512 bytes each. The simulation should run for 10 seconds.
