Generate an NS-3 C++ simulation script for a CSMA (Ethernet-based) network with four nodes. The first node should act as a TCP server on port 8080, while the other three nodes should be TCP clients sending data to the server at 5 Mbps. The CSMA network should have a 100 Mbps data rate with a propagation delay of 6560 ns. The simulation should run for 10 seconds, and packet capture (PCAP) should be enabled for analysis.
