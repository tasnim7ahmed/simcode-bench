Generate an NS-3 C++ simulation script for a CSMA-based local area network with four nodes connected via a shared medium. The CSMA link should have a data rate of 100 Mbps and a delay of 1 millisecond. The third node should act as a UDP echo server on port 9, while the first node should be a UDP echo client sending five packets of 512 bytes each. The simulation should run for 10 seconds.
