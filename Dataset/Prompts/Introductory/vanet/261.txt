Generate an NS-3 C++ simulation script for a Vehicular Ad-Hoc Network (VANET) using the IEEE 802.11p (WAVE) protocol. The network should consist of three vehicles, each with a unique IPv4 address in the 10.1.1.0/24 subnet. Vehicles should use the ConstantVelocityMobilityModel with speeds of 20 m/s, 15 m/s, and 25 m/s, respectively. The last vehicle should act as a UDP echo server on port 9, while the first vehicle should be a client sending five packets of 1024 bytes each. The simulation should run for 10 seconds.
