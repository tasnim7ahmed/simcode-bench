Generate an NS-3 C++ simulation script for a simple point-to-point network with two nodes connected via a wired link. The link should have a bandwidth of 10 Mbps and a delay of 2 milliseconds. The first node should act as a TCP BulkSend application transmitting unlimited data to the second node, which runs a TCP PacketSink application on port 9. The simulation should run for 10 seconds.
