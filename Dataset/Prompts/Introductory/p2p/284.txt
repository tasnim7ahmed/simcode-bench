Generate an NS-3 C++ script simulating a point-to-point network with two nodes. The link should have a data rate of 5 Mbps and a delay of 2 ms. One node should act as a TCP bulk sender, and the other should act as a TCP sink on port 9. The simulation should run for 10 seconds, with PCAP tracing enabled.
