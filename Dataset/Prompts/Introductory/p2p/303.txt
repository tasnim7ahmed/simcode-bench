Generate an NS-3 C++ script that creates a point-to-point network between two nodes with a 10 Mbps data rate and a 2 ms propagation delay. The nodes should use the 10.1.1.0/24 subnet. Node 1 should act as a TCP server listening on port 8080, and Node 0 should be a TCP client sending a maximum of 500,000 bytes of data. The server should start at 1 second and the client at 2 seconds, with the simulation running for 10 seconds.
