Generate an NS-3 C++ script that simulates a Mobile Ad-Hoc Network (MANET) with 5 nodes. The nodes use the AODV routing protocol, and their movement is simulated with the RandomWaypointMobilityModel. The nodes randomly move within a 100x100m area. Node 0 sends UDP packets to node 4, while node 4 receives the data. The network communication occurs using Wi-Fi with the 802.11b standard. The simulation runs for 10 seconds, with the application starting at 2 seconds.
