Generate an NS-3 C++ script that simulates a Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) with two nodes. The nodes communicate via UDP: one node acts as a server on port 9, and the other node acts as a client. The client sends 1,000 UDP packets of 1024 bytes each with an interval of 0.01 seconds. The nodes are configured with random waypoint mobility and move within a 100m x 100m area at a constant speed of 20 m/s. The simulation runs for 10 seconds, with the server starting at 1 second and the client starting at 2 seconds.
