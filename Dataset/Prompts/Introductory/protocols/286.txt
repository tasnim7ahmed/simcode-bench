Generate an NS-3 C++ script simulating a Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) with five nodes using AODV routing. The nodes should move randomly using the RandomWaypointMobilityModel with a speed of 5 m/s and a pause time of 2 seconds. The network should use 802.11b WiFi for communication. Node 0 should be a UDP client sending 512-byte packets every 50ms to Node 4, which acts as a UDP server on port 4000. The simulation should run for 20 seconds, with PCAP tracing enabled.
