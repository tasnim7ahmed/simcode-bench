Generate an NS-3 C++ simulation script for a Wi-Fi mesh network using the 802.11s mesh protocol. The network should consist of five nodes with unique IPv4 addresses in the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet. Nodes should use the RandomWalk2dMobilityModel within a bounded area (-50, 50, -50, 50). The last node should act as a UDP echo server on port 9, while the first node should be a client sending three packets of 512 bytes each. The simulation should run for 10 seconds.
