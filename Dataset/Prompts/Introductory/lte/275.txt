Generate an NS-3 C++ simulation script for a simple LTE network with one evolved NodeB (eNB) and one User Equipment (UE). The eNB should be static, while the UE should move randomly within a 100x100 area using the Random Walk mobility model. Set the IP address for the UE and eNB. Create a Simplex UDP server on the eNB and a Simplex UDP client on the UE, where the UE sends five 512-byte packets at 1-second intervals to the eNB. The simulation should run for 10 seconds.
