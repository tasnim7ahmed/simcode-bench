Generate an NS-3 C++ script simulating an LTE network with one eNodeB and three UE nodes. The UE nodes should be mobile within a 100x100 area, while the eNodeB remains stationary. UE 0 should act as a UDP server on port 5000, while UE 1 should be a UDP client sending 512-byte packets every 10ms. The LTE network should assign IP addresses to the UEs, and PCAP tracing should be enabled. The simulation should run for 10 seconds.
