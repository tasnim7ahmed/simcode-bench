Generate an NS-3 C++ script that simulates a Wi-Fi network with a UDP connection between a station (STA) and an access point (AP). The STA should act as a UDP client, and the AP should act as a UDP server. The Wi-Fi standard should be 802.11n. The client should send 50 packets of 1024 bytes each at an interval of 200ms. The server should receive the packets. Assign IP addresses from the range 192.168.1.0/24. The simulation should run for 10 seconds.
