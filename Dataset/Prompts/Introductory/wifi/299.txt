Generate an NS-3 C++ script simulating a Wi-Fi network with two nodes. The first node (Node A) sends 128-byte UDP packets to the second node (Node B) every 100ms. The simulation should run for 10 seconds. Use 802.11 Wi-Fi communication and set up the nodes with constant position mobility. Enable PCAP tracing for Wi-Fi communication, and install an UDP server on Node B and a UDP client on Node A.
