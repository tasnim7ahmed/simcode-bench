Generate an NS-3 C++ script that simulates a Wi-Fi network with two nodes. One node acts as a HTTP server on port 80, and the other node acts as a HTTP client. The client requests a web page from the server. The nodes are stationary and have static positions in a grid layout with a 5m x 5m grid. The Wi-Fi channel is based on the 802.11b standard. The simulation runs for 10 seconds, with the server starting at 1 second and the client starting at 2 seconds.
