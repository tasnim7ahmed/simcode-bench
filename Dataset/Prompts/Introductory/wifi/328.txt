Generate an NS-3 C++ script that sets up a simple Wi-Fi network with 2 nodes. The nodes use 802.11b Wi-Fi and are configured with the ConstantPositionMobilityModel for stationary behavior. Node 0 (the sender) transmits UDP packets to Node 1 (the receiver) at a constant rate of 500kb/s. The simulation should last for 10 seconds, with the application starting at 1 second and stopping at 10 seconds.
