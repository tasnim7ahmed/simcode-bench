Generate an NS-3 C++ script for a Wi-Fi network with two nodes, using 802.11b. The nodes should have a fixed position. One node should send UDP packets to the other using a UDP client-server model. The sender should send 1000 packets of 512 bytes each at a rate of 100 packets per second (10 ms interval). The UDP server should listen on port 8080. The simulation should run for 10 seconds, with the sender starting at 2 seconds and the receiver at 1 second.
