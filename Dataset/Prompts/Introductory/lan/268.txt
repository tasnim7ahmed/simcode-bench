Generate an NS-3 C++ simulation script for a four-node wired LAN network using the CSMA protocol. The nodes should be connected via a CSMA switch with a data rate of 100 Mbps and a propagation delay of 6.56 microseconds. Each node should have a unique IPv4 address in the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet. The last node should run a UDP echo server on port 9, while the first node should act as a client sending ten packets of 512 bytes each. The simulation should run for 10 seconds.
