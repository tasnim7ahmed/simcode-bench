Write an NS-3 simulation in C++ where a group of nodes communicates using UDP over a VANET (Vehicular Ad-Hoc Network). The nodes should use the DSDV (Destination-Sequenced Distance-Vector) routing protocol for maintaining up-to-date routes. Vehicles should move along a highway using the WaypointMobilityModel, and each vehicle should periodically send UDP packets to a central roadside unit (RSU). The simulation should run for 30 seconds.
