Generate an NS-3 C++ simulation script for a 5G NR (mmWave) network. The network should include a single gNB (base station) and two UEs (user devices). The gNB should be stationary, while the UEs should use a random walk mobility model. Assign IPv4 addresses in the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet. The second UE should act as a UDP echo server on port 9, while the first UE should act as a client, sending five packets of 1024 bytes each. The simulation should run for 10 seconds.
