Generate an NS-3 C++ simulation script for a simple 5G NR network with one gNodeB (5G base station) and two UEs. The UEs should be using a random walk mobility model within a 50x50 area. Set up the network devices, assign IP addresses, and configure TCP communication. The first UE will act as a TCP client, sending packets to a server running on the second UE. The simulation should run for 10 seconds, and the server should be listening on port 8080.
