Generate an NS-3 C++ script to set up a TCP client-server communication. There are two nodes: Node 0 (client) and Node 1 (server). The server listens on TCP port 8080 and starts accepting connections at 1 second, stopping at 10 seconds. The client sends 10 TCP packets, each of 1024 bytes, with an interval of 1 second, starting at 2 seconds and stopping at 10 seconds. Both nodes should have IP addresses in the subnet 10.1.1.0/24.
