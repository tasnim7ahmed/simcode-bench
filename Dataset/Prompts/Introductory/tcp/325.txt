Generate an NS-3 C++ script that simulates a TCP connection between two nodes using a point-to-point link. The client sends data to the server, and the Round-Trip Time (RTT) is measured and logged during the communication. The point-to-point link has a data rate of 5 Mbps and a delay of 10 ms. The server starts at 1 second, and the client starts at 2 seconds. The simulation runs for 10 seconds, and the RTT value should be printed during the simulation.
