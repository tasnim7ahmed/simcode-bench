Generate an NS-3 C++ script to simulate a TCP connection between two nodes over a point-to-point link. The first node should act as the TCP client, and the second node should act as the TCP server. The client should send UDP packets to the server with a packet size of 1024 bytes, a maximum of 100 packets, and an interval of 100ms. The link should have a data rate of 5 Mbps and a delay of 2ms. The simulation should run for 10 seconds.
