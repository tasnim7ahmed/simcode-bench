Generate an NS-3 C++ script that sets up a simple TCP communication between two nodes. One node runs a TCP server on port 8080, and the other node acts as a TCP client. The client sends 10 TCP packets of 1024 bytes each, with a packet interval of 1 second. The simulation runs for 10 seconds, with the server starting at 1 second and the client starting at 2 seconds.
