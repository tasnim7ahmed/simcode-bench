Generate an NS-3 C++ script that sets up a simple TCP connection between three nodes. Two of the nodes (Node 0 and Node 1) act as clients, and one node (Node 2) is the TCP server. Use PointToPoint links to connect the nodes with a 1Mbps data rate and 2ms delay. The server (Node 2) listens on port 9, while the clients send TCP traffic starting at 2 seconds (Node 0) and 3 seconds (Node 1). The simulation should last for 10 seconds.
