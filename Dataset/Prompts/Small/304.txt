Generate an NS-3 C++ script that sets up a Wi-Fi network with one access point (AP) and two stations (STA). The AP and STAs should use 802.11g Wi-Fi standard. The network should assign 192.168.1.x IP addresses. Station 1 should act as a UDP server listening on port 8080, while Station 0 should act as a UDP client, sending 1024-byte packets every 10 milliseconds starting at 2 seconds. The client should send a maximum of 1000 packets. The simulation should run for 10 seconds.
