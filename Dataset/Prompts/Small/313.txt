Generate an NS-3 C++ script to set up a simple Wi-Fi network with two stations (STA) and one access point (AP). The AP should have a fixed position, and the STA devices should move randomly within a defined area. The STA 0 should act as a UDP server listening on port 9, while STA 1 should act as a UDP client, sending 1,000 packets of 1024 bytes each, with a packet interval of 0.01 seconds. The simulation should run for 10 seconds.
