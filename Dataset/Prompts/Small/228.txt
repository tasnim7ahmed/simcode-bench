Write an NS-3 simulation in C++ where vehicles in a VANET (Vehicular Ad Hoc Network) communicate using UDP over a Wi-Fi network. The vehicles should follow a realistic mobility model using the SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility) tool and the ns-3 Mobility module. Use the DSR (Dynamic Source Routing) protocol to establish routes between vehicles dynamically. The simulation should run for 80 seconds.
