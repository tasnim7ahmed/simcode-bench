Generate an NS-3 C++ simulation script for a VANET using Wi-Fi 802.11p (WAVE). Create three vehicles, each assigned a unique IP address in the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet. Use a constant velocity mobility model with vehicles moving at different speeds along the X-axis. The last vehicle should act as a UDP echo server on port 9, while the first vehicle should act as a client, sending three packets of 512 bytes each. The simulation should run for 10 seconds.
