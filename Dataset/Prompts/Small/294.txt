Generate an NS-3 C++ script to simulate a Wi-Fi mesh network using Ad-Hoc mode with 5 nodes. Each node should communicate with the others using UDP packets. Set up a UDP server on the last node and a UDP client on the first node. The Wi-Fi nodes should use the AarfWifiManager for station management and have random mobility. The UDP client sends packets to the UDP server with a packet size of 1024 bytes, a maximum of 100 packets, and an interval of 100ms. The simulation should run for 10 seconds.
