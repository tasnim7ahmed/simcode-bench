Generate an NS-3 C++ simulation script for a WiFi network with one access point (AP) and three station (STA) nodes. The AP should act as a UDP server on port 4000, while the station nodes should be UDP clients sending packets at 512 bytes every 10ms. The network should use 802.11g WiFi, and the STAs should have random mobility within a 50x50 area. The simulation should last 10 seconds, with PCAP tracing enabled for the AP.
