Generate an NS-3 C++ script to create a simple Wi-Fi network with a UDP communication between two nodes: Station (STA) and Access Point (AP). The STA sends 10 UDP packets of 1024 bytes each, with a 1-second interval to the AP, which listens on port 9. The station has a random mobility model in a 100x100 mÂ² area, while the AP remains stationary. The IP address range used for both devices is 10.1.1.0/24.
