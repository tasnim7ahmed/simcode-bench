Generate an NS-3 C++ simulation script for a simple wired CSMA network with four nodes. The network should have a data rate of 100 Mbps and a propagation delay of 6560 nanoseconds. Assign an IPv4 address range of 192.168.1.0/24. The last node should act as a UDP echo server on port 9, while the first node should act as a client, sending two packets of 1024 bytes each. The simulation should run for 10 seconds.
