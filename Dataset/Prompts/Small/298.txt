Generate an NS-3 C++ script to simulate a mobile LTE network with two eNodeBs (base stations) and one user equipment (UE). The UE performs TCP data transfer while moving between the two eNodeBs. The simulation should demonstrate handover as the UE moves, and it should run for 10 seconds with a UDP server on the first eNodeB and a UDP client on the UE. The mobility of the UE should be modeled with a random walk between the eNodeBs. The LTE stack should be installed, and the handover should occur during the data transfer.
