Generate an NS-3 C++ script to simulate a Wi-Fi network with two mobile devices (STA) and a single access point (AP). Both devices exchange UDP packets (1024 bytes each) with the access point on port 9, with a 1-second interval between each packet. The mobile devices are using a random walk mobility model in a 100m x 100m area, while the access point is stationary. Use the Wi-Fi 802.11n 5GHz standard and assign IP addresses in the 10.1.1.0/24 range.
