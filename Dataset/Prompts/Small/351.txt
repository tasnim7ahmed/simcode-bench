Generate an NS-3 C++ script that simulates a Wi-Fi network with two nodes: one acting as an Access Point (AP) and the other as a Wi-Fi client. The AP should run a UDP server on port 8080, while the client should run a UDP client sending 20 packets of size 512 bytes at an interval of 0.5 seconds. The simulation should assign IP addresses in the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet, with the AP at 192.168.1.1. Both nodes should have a constant position mobility model, and the simulation should run for 10 seconds, starting the server at 1 second and the client at 2 seconds.
