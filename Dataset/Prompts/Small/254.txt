"Generate a simple NS-3 C++ simulation script that sets up a basic point-to-point network with two nodes. The connection should have a bandwidth of 5 Mbps and a delay of 2 ms. Configure the nodes with an IPv4 address range of 192.168.1.0/24. One node should run a UDP echo server on port 9, while the other node should send a single packet of 1024 bytes to the server. The simulation should run for 10 seconds."
