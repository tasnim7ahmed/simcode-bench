Generate an NS-3 C++ script that simulates a Wi-Fi network with one access point (AP) and one client station (STA). The AP and client should use the 802.11 standard with a single SSID. The client should be stationary and should send UDP packets to the AP. The UDP client should send 100 packets of 512 bytes at 0.1-second intervals to the UDP server running on the AP. The network should use the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet. The server should start at 1 second, and the client should start at 2 seconds, running until 10 seconds.
