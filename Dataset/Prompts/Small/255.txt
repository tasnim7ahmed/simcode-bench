Generate an NS-3 C++ simulation script for a simple Wi-Fi network. The network should have one station (STA) and one access point (AP). Use the AARF Wi-Fi manager and configure the STA to associate with an SSID named 'ns3-wifi'. The nodes should be placed on a grid using a position allocator. Assign an IPv4 address range of 192.168.1.0/24. The AP should run a UDP echo server on port 9, and the STA should send a single packet of 1024 bytes. The simulation should run for 10 seconds.
