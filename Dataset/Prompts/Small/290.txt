Generate an NS-3 C++ script simulating an LTE network with one eNodeB (base station) and one UE (User Equipment). The UE should be randomly moving within a 100x100 area, while the eNodeB remains stationary. The UE should act as a UDP server on port 5000, and the eNodeB should act as a UDP client sending 1024-byte packets every 200ms. The simulation should run for 10 seconds, with LTE PHY, MAC, and RLC tracing enabled.
