Write an NS-3 simulation in C++ where a client communicates with a server using a raw UDP socket. The client should send packets to the server at regular intervals, and the server should log the received packets. Set up a simple point-to-point network with an IP address configuration. Implement custom UDP socket applications for both client and server instead of using NS-3â€™s built-in UdpEchoClient and UdpEchoServer. The simulation should run for 10 seconds.
