Generate an NS-3 C++ script for a Wi-Fi network with two nodes, using the 802.11n 5GHz standard. The nodes should be 5 meters apart. One node should run a UDP Echo server on port 9, starting at 1 second. The other node should act as a UDP Echo client, sending 10 packets of 1024 bytes each at 1-second intervals, starting at 2 seconds. The simulation should run for 10 seconds. The IP network should be 192.168.1.x, and nodes should have fixed positions.
