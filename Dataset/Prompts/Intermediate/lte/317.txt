Generate an NS-3 C++ script to set up a simple LTE network with one User Equipment (UE) and one evolved NodeB (eNB). The UE runs a UDP client on port 9, and the eNB runs a UDP server. The UE sends 1,000 UDP packets of 1024 bytes each, with a packet interval of 0.01 seconds. The simulation should run for 10 seconds, with the server starting at 1 second and the client starting at 2 seconds.
