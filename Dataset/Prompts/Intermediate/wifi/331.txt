Generate an NS-3 C++ script to set up a simple wireless network with WiFi nodes. The network consists of two nodes, where Node 0 is the TCP client and Node 1 is the TCP server. Use 802.11b WiFi standard and create a simple TCP connection between the nodes. Set the Ssid for WiFi to 'ns-3-ssid' and the TCP port to 9. The server starts at 1 second and stops at 10 seconds, while the client starts at 2 seconds and stops at 10 seconds.
