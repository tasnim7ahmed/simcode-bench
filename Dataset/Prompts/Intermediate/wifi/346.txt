Generate an NS-3 C++ script to simulate a Wi-Fi network with two nodes, where Node 0 is a Wi-Fi Access Point (AP) and Node 1 is a Wi-Fi Station (STA). The Wi-Fi communication should use the 802.11n standard, and both nodes should be placed within a grid of 2x2 meters. Install an Internet stack on both nodes and assign IP addresses to the devices. Use a UDP Echo Server on the AP and a UDP Echo Client on the STA. The simulation should run for 10 seconds, with the client sending one 1024-byte packet every 1 second to the server, starting at 2 seconds.
