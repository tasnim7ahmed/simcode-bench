Generate an NS-3 C++ script to simulate a Wi-Fi network where a Client (STA) and an Access Point (AP) communicate using TCP. The Client sends 10 TCP packets (of 1024 bytes) to the Access Point at a 1-second interval. The Access Point listens on port 9. The Client follows a random walk mobility model within a 100x100 mÂ² area, while the Access Point remains stationary. Use IPv4 addressing within the 10.1.1.0/24 subnet.
