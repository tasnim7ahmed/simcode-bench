Generate an NS-3 C++ script to simulate a Wi-Fi communication between two nodes in an ad hoc network using the 802.11b standard. One node should act as a UDP server and the other as a UDP client. The communication should use UDP packets, with the client sending 10 packets of 1024 bytes at a 1-second interval. The server should be installed on Node 0, and the client on Node 1. The simulation should run for 10 seconds, starting the server at 1 second and the client at 2 seconds. Use an SSID named "wifi-adhoc-network" and configure the Wi-Fi physical and MAC layers accordingly.
