Generate an NS-3 C++ script that simulates a Wi-Fi network with three nodes communicating using UDP. The network should use 802.11n, with nodes positioned in a grid layout. Node 0 should act as a UDP echo server listening on port 9, while Node 2 should act as a UDP echo client, sending five packets of 1024 bytes at 1-second intervals to Node 0. The simulation should run from 1 second to 10 seconds, using the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet.
