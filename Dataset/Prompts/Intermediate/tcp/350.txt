Generate an NS-3 C++ script to simulate TCP communication between two nodes in a point-to-point network. One node should act as a TCP server and the other as a TCP client. The client should send 10 packets of size 1024 bytes at a 1-second interval. The server should be installed on Node 0, and the client on Node 1. The nodes should be connected via a point-to-point link with a 5 Mbps data rate and 2 ms delay. The simulation should run for 10 seconds, with the server starting at 1 second and the client starting at 2 seconds.
