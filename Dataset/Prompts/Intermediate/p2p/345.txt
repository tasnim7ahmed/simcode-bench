Generate an NS-3 C++ script to simulate a simple wired network using a point-to-point link with two nodes. The nodes should be connected with a 5 Mbps data rate and a 2 ms delay. Node 1 should act as a TCP server listening on port 9. Node 0 should act as a TCP client, sending 10 packets of 512 bytes to the server at intervals of 0.1 seconds. The simulation should run for 10 seconds.
