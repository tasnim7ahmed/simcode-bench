Generate an NS-3 C++ script to set up a simple wired network with HTTP traffic between two nodes. Use PointToPoint links to connect the nodes with a 1Mbps data rate and 10ms delay. Node 0 is the HTTP client, and Node 1 is the HTTP server. The HTTP server listens on port 80. The HTTP client starts generating traffic at 2 seconds and stops at 10 seconds. The server starts at 1 second and stops at 10 seconds.
