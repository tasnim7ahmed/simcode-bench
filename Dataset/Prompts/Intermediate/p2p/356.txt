Generate an NS-3 C++ script that simulates a Point-to-Point (P2P) wired network between two nodes. The link should have a data rate of 5 Mbps and a propagation delay of 2 ms. Node 0 should send TCP traffic using a BulkSend application, transmitting unlimited data to Node 1, which runs a PacketSink application to receive the packets. The simulation should run from 1 second to 10 seconds, using the 10.1.1.0/24 subnet.
