Generate a C++ program using NS-3 that simulates a network with a hub and trunk ports. The hub connects four nodes, where three nodes belong to different subnets (acting as separate VLANs) and communicate with each other via a central hub node. The hub node acts as a router, routing traffic between the subnets. Use the CSMA helper to simulate the shared medium, assign different subnets to each node, and set up routing tables. Enable packet tracing to capture the traffic and generate a pcap trace file.
