Create a simulation in NS-3 that demonstrates the classical hidden terminal problem and its solution using RTS/CTS in an ad-hoc Wi-Fi network. Set up a topology with three nodes, where node 0 and node 2 are hidden from each other, and both communicate with node 1. Use the MatrixPropagationLossModel to simulate a 50 dB loss between adjacent nodes. Configure the simulation to use 802.11b Wi-Fi in ad-hoc mode, and install the Internet stack and IP addresses. Generate two CBR streams using the OnOffApplication, where node 0 sends to node 1, and node 2 sends to node 1, with each flow slightly staggered to avoid NS-3 bugs. Enable flow monitoring and simulate for 10 seconds, capturing performance statistics like throughput and packet loss. Run the simulation twiceâ€”once with RTS/CTS disabled and once with it enabled for packets larger than 100 bytes. Print out the flow statistics after each run.
