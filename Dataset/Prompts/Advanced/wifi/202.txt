Simulate a wireless sensor network (WSN) with six nodes arranged in a circular topology using ns-3. Each node uses the IEEE 802.15.4 standard for low-rate wireless communication and operates in the 2.4 GHz frequency band. Set up one of the nodes as a data collector (sink) that receives sensor data from the other five nodes. Implement a simple UDP-based data transfer, where each node sends a packet to the sink node at regular intervals. Collect performance metrics such as packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay, and throughput, and visualize the packet flows using NetAnim.
