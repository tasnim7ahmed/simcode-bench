Simulate a Wi-Fi network in ns-3 with two access points (APs) and multiple stations (STA). Each AP supports a group of stations, and the stations are configured to communicate with their respective APs. Use UDP as the transport protocol, and set up a UDP client-server application where the stations send continuous data to a server. Enable pcap and ASCII tracing for traffic analysis, and print the total data sent by each station.
