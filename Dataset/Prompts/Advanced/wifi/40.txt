Generate a C++ script using ns-3 that configures two nodes with 802.11b NICs operating in ad-hoc mode. The nodes are set to communicate over a physical layer that uses a fixed received signal strength (RSS), regardless of their positions. The script should allow sending one 1000-byte packet by default between the nodes and provide several command-line options for modifying behavior. Ensure the physical layer stops receiving packets when the RSS drops below a threshold, and implement verbose logging, pcap trace generation, and command-line control for attributes like RSS and packet size.
