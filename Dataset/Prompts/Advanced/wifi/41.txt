Write a C++ program using ns-3 that configures a grid of nodes with 802.11b NICs operating in adhoc mode. The grid is by default 5x5, and each node is positioned using the GridPositionAllocator. The program should allow command-line options to modify parameters such as the physical layer mode, grid distance, packet size, number of packets, source and sink nodes, and enable verbose logging. By default, one 1000-byte packet is sent from the highest-numbered node (node 24) to node 0, and OLSR routing is enabled to determine the packet forwarding path. Include options to enable packet tracing using pcap and ASCII trace files, and allow customization of the source and sink nodes. The script should also simulate wireless transmission effects, including distance-based RSSI cutoff.
