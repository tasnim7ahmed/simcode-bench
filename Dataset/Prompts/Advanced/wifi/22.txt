Develop an NS-3 simulation to validate error rate models for DSSS rates by calculating and plotting the Frame Success Rate against the Signal-to-Noise Ratio for various DSSS modes. In the `main` function, set the frame size and configure Gnuplot for output. Create instances of different error rate models, including Yans, Nist, and Table-based models, and loop through the defined DSSS modes. For each mode, compute the success rates based on varying SNR values and validate the results against expected ranges. Collect the data in a Gnuplot dataset and generate a visual output in EPS format, depicting the relationship between SNR and Frame Success Rate.
