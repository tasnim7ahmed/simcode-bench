Write a C++ script using the ns-3 network simulator that configures two nodes with 802.11b physical layer in adhoc mode. One node generates on-off traffic destined for the other node. The script should allow for testing energy depletion of nodes, and trigger a callback when the node enters a sleep state due to energy depletion. The script should also include the ability to adjust transmission power and log remaining energy and state transitions to trace files. Include command-line options for configuring data rate, packet size, transmission power levels, and energy model parameters.
