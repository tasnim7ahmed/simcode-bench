Write a C++ simulation program using the ns-3 network simulator that sets up a simple Wi-Fi network using either `ns3::SpectrumWifiPhy` or `ns3::YansWifiPhy` for the physical layer. This program should include configuration for multiple modulation and coding schemes (MCS), channel widths, and guard intervals, and allow the user to modify the simulation's parameters through the command line, such as simulation time, distance between nodes, and Wi-Fi and error model types. It should create a Wi-Fi station (STA) and access point (AP) node, transmit UDP packets under different conditions, and output throughput statistics like modulation scheme, channel width, and received data throughput for each MCS index.
