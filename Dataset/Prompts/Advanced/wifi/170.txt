Simulate a wireless LAN network using ns-3 where a single access point (AP) communicates with two wireless stations (STAs). Configure TCP traffic where one station acts as a server and another as a client. The Wi-Fi standard should be 802.11b with a data rate of 11 Mbps. Run the simulation for 10 seconds and use pcap tracing to capture packet transmissions. Measure the throughput at the server side and display packet counts at the end of the simulation.
