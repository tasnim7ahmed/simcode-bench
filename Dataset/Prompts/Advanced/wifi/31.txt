Provide code that validates NIST and YANS error rate models for EHT rates in NS-3. The program should output plots of Frame Success Rate versus Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) for Nist, Yans, and Table-based error rate models, iterating over every HT MCS value. The simulation should use Gnuplot to generate visual outputs and include configurations for frame size and range of SNR values.
