Generate a simulation program using the ns-3 network simulator to experiment with 802.11ax spatial reuse mechanisms. The scenario should involve two Basic Service Sets (BSS) represented by two access points (AP1, AP2) and their corresponding stations (STA1, STA2), each transmitting data with configurable parameters like distance (d1, d2, d3), transmit power, CCA-ED thresholds, and OBSS-PD thresholds. The prompt should explain that STA1 sends data to AP1, while STA2 sends to AP2, both continuously transmitting with specified traffic loads (intervals, packet size). OBSS-PD spatial reuse, which allows stations to ignore transmissions below a certain threshold, can be enabled or disabled, affecting the throughput. The model should support dynamic configuration through command-line arguments, logging reset events related to spatial reuse in text files, and output the resulting throughput of each BSS at the end of the simulation. The simulation should also include appropriate channel configuration, such as handling varying channel widths (20 MHz, 40 MHz, 80 MHz), and the corresponding effects on RSSI and collision probability.
