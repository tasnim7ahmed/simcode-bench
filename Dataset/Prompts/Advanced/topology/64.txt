Generate a C++ program using NS-3 to simulate a star network topology with 9 nodes, where 8 "arm" nodes are connected to a central "hub" node. The nodes on the arms will send Constant Bit Rate (CBR) traffic to the hub using TCP. Enable packet tracing and output trace files in pcap format, with filenames of the format "tcp-star-server-\$n-\$i.pcap", where `n` and `i` represent node and interface numbers. The command line should allow users to specify the number of nodes and modify the packet size and data rate of the traffic. Output should include queue and packet reception traces in the file "tcp-star-server.tr".
