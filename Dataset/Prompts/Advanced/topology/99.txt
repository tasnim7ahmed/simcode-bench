Generate a C++ program using ns-3 to simulate a simple three-router network with global routing. Set up a point-to-point network between three nodes (A, B, C), with node A having a /32 host route, node B handling transit routing, and node C having its own /32 host route. Assign point-to-point links between A-B and B-C, configure global and static routing for the network, and inject routes at node B. Implement an OnOff UDP application at node A to send traffic to node C, and include packet tracing and PCAP capturing functionality.
