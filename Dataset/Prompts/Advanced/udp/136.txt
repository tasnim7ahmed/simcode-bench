Generate a C++ program using ns-3 to simulate a UDP Echo Client and Server between two nodes. Set up a point-to-point connection between the nodes with a link of 5Mbps data rate and 2ms delay. The client on one node should send UDP packets to the server on the other node, and the simulation should log packet transmission and reception. Include packet size, interval, and the number of packets to be transmitted in the configuration.
