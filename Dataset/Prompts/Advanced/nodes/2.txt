Create an NS-3 simulation in C++ that models a basic network with two nodes. Connect these nodes using a point-to-point link with a data transmission rate of 5 Mbps and a propagation delay of 2 milliseconds. Do not configure any IP addresses or communication protocols for the nodes; the focus is only on setting up the link between them. Once the point-to-point link has been established between the two nodes, the simulation should verify the setup and conclude.
