Generate a C++ program using the ns-3 library to simulate a three-router network topology where nodes A, B, and C are connected via point-to-point links. Configure static routing for the communication between the nodes, using /32 IP addressing for specific interfaces. Set up point-to-point channels with a specified data rate and delay. Assign appropriate IP addresses to the interfaces, and configure static routes from node A to node C through node B. Additionally, create an OnOff application on node A to send UDP packets to node C, and a packet sink on node C to receive these packets. Enable tracing and packet capture for the simulation.
