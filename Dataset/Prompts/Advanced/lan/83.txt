Write a C++ program using the ns-3 network simulator to create a simple LAN (CSMA) connecting two nodes, n0 and n1. Implement a UDP flow from n0 to n1, where packets of 1024 bytes are sent at 50 ms intervals, with a maximum of 320 packets transmitted or limited by simulation duration. Provide options to enable either IPv4 or IPv6 addressing, as well as to toggle logging of the simulation events. Simulate the network for 10 seconds, starting the client after a 2-second delay.
