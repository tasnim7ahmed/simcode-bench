Generate an NS-3 C++ simulation script for a wireless LAN (Wi-Fi) network using the 802.11n standard. The network should have three stations (STA) and one Access Point (AP). The AP should be configured with a fixed SSID 'ns3-wifi'. Each node should have a unique IPv4 address in the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet. One station should act as a UDP echo client sending five packets of 512 bytes each to the AP, which runs a UDP echo server on port 9. The simulation should run for 10 seconds.
