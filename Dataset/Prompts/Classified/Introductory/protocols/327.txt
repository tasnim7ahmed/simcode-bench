Generate an NS-3 C++ script that simulates a Mobile Ad-Hoc Network (MANET) with 6 nodes using the OLSR routing protocol. The nodes are mobile and use the RandomWaypointMobilityModel for movement within a 100x100m area. Nodes have speeds between 5m/s and 15m/s, and the simulation runs for 10 seconds. A UDP packet is sent from node 0 to node 5. The simulation should print the routing behavior as nodes move and adjust the network topology.
