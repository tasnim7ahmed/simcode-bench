Generate an NS-3 C++ script simulating a wireless sensor network (WSN) with 10 nodes using the ZigBee protocol. One node should act as the coordinator, and the others should act as end devices. Each end device should send 128-byte UDP packets to the coordinator every 500ms. The simulation should run for 10 seconds. Use ZigBee PRO mode, and set the node mobility to random walk within a 100m x 100m area. Enable PCAP tracing for the ZigBee communication.
