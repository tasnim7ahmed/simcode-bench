Generate an NS-3 C++ simulation script for a three-node ad-hoc wireless network using the AODV routing protocol. The nodes should use the 802.11b Wi-Fi standard, be arranged in a linear layout with a 10-meter separation, and have unique IPv4 addresses in the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet. The last node should run a UDP echo server on port 9, while the first node should act as a client sending five packets of 512 bytes each. The simulation should run for 10 seconds.
