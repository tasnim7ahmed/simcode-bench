Generate an NS-3 C++ script for a three-node ad-hoc wireless network using the AODV routing protocol. The network should operate on 802.11g Wi-Fi. The nodes should be positioned in a straight line, 100 meters apart. The first node should send UDP packets to the third node, while the second node acts as a router. A UDP Echo server should run on Node 2 (port 9) starting at 1 second. The client on Node 0 should send 5 packets of 512 bytes at 2-second intervals, starting at 2 seconds. The simulation should run for 20 seconds. The IP network should be 10.1.1.x.
