Generate an NS-3 C++ script that sets up a simple point-to-point network with two nodes. The link should have a 5 Mbps data rate and a 2 ms delay. Node 0 should send TCP traffic to Node 1 using the BulkSendApplication. The receiver (Node 1) should use a TCP Packet Sink on port 8080. The TCP sender should start at 1 second and continue sending unlimited data until 10 seconds. The network should use the 192.168.1.x subnet.
