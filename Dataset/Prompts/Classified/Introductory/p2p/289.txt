Generate an NS-3 C++ script simulating a Point-to-Point (P2P) network with two nodes connected by a 10Mbps link with a 2ms delay. Node 1 should act as a TCP server on port 5000, while Node 0 should act as a TCP client sending 1024-byte packets at 5Mbps. The simulation should run for 10 seconds, with PCAP tracing enabled.
