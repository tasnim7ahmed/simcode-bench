Generate an NS-3 C++ script simulating a point-to-point network between two nodes with a TCP bulk sender on Node 0 and a TCP sink on Node 1. The link should have a 5 Mbps data rate and a 2 ms delay. The IP range should be 10.1.1.0/24. The TCP sink should start at 1 second and run until 10 seconds, while the TCP sender starts at 2 seconds. The sender should transfer unlimited data (MaxBytes = 0).
