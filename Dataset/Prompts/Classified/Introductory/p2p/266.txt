Generate an NS-3 C++ simulation script for a simple Point-to-Point (P2P) network with two nodes. The nodes should be connected via a P2P link with a data rate of 5 Mbps and a propagation delay of 2 milliseconds. Each node should have a unique IPv4 address in the 10.1.1.0/24 subnet. The second node should run a UDP echo server on port 9, while the first node acts as a client sending five packets of 512 bytes each. The simulation should run for 10 seconds.
