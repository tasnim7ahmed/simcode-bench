Generate an NS-3 C++ script that sets up a wired network with two hosts connected via Point-to-Point links. The link should have a data rate of 5 Mbps and a delay of 2 ms. The first host (Node 0) should act as a TCP server on port 8080, while the second host (Node 1) should act as a TCP client, sending 1,000,000 bytes of data. The simulation should start at 1 second for the server and 2 seconds for the client, running for 10 seconds.
