Generate an NS-3 C++ simulation script for a Mobile Ad-Hoc Network (MANET) with 5 nodes using the AODV routing protocol. The nodes should move randomly within a 100x100 area using the Random Walk mobility model. Assign IP addresses in the 10.1.1.0/24 subnet. Create a UDP echo server on node 4 and a UDP echo client on node 0 to send five 512-byte packets at 1-second intervals. The simulation should run for 10 seconds.
