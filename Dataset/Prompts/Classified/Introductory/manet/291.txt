Generate an NS-3 C++ script simulating a Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) with 10 nodes using AODV routing protocol. The nodes should move randomly within a 500m x 500m area at 5 m/s, with a 2-second pause time. The network should use WiFi (802.11b, Ad Hoc mode). One node should act as a UDP server on port 4000, while another node should act as a UDP client sending 1024-byte packets every second. The simulation should run for 20 seconds, with PCAP tracing enabled.
