Generate an NS-3 C++ script to simulate a mobile ad hoc network (MANET) with two nodes. Configure random movement for both nodes using a random walk mobility model with speeds between 1 and 5 m/s and a time interval of 2 seconds. The nodes should send UDP packets from the client (node 0) to the server (node 1) over a 1 Mbps link with a 10 ms delay. Use port 9 for communication, and set the client to send 100 packets of 512 bytes with an interval of 0.1 seconds. The simulation should run for 20 seconds.
