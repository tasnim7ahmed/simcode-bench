Generate an NS-3 C++ simulation script for a Mobile Ad-Hoc Network (MANET) using the AODV routing protocol. The network should consist of five nodes, each assigned a unique IPv4 address in the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet. Nodes should move using a RandomWalk2dMobilityModel within a bounded area (-50,50,-50,50). The last node should act as a UDP echo server on port 9, while the first node should be a client sending three packets of 512 bytes each. The simulation should run for 10 seconds.
