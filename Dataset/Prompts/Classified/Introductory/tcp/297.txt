Generate an NS-3 C++ script to simulate a TCP connection between two nodes over a Point-to-Point link. Use the TCP NewReno protocol for the connection. The script should measure the network throughput using a FlowMonitor and capture the FlowMonitor output in an XML file. The link between the nodes should have a 5Mbps data rate and 2ms delay. The simulation should run for 10 seconds, and the TCP server should be installed on Node 1, while the TCP client should be installed on Node 0.
