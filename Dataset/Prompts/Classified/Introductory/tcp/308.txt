Generate an NS-3 C++ script for a wired point-to-point network with two nodes, connected by a link with a data rate of 5 Mbps and 2 ms delay. The first node should send TCP traffic using a BulkSend application, and the second node should act as a TCP receiver (sink). The receiver should start at 1 second, and the sender should start at 2 seconds. The simulation should run for 10 seconds. The TCP sink should listen on port 9, and the BulkSend application should send unlimited data.
