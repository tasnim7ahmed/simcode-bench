Generate an NS-3 C++ simulation script for a 5G NR network with one gNodeB (5G base station) and one User Equipment (UE). The gNodeB should be static, while the UE should be placed randomly within a 100x100 area using the Random Walk mobility model. Set up the NR network with appropriate devices and assign IP addresses. Create a TCP server on the gNodeB and a TCP client on the UE. The UE should send five 512-byte packets at 1-second intervals to the gNodeB. The simulation should run for 10 seconds.
