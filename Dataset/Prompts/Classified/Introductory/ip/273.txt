Generate an NS-3 C++ simulation script for a Wi-Fi network with three station nodes (STAs) and one access point (AP) operating in infrastructure mode using the 802.11n standard. The STAs should have random mobility, while the AP remains stationary. Assign IP addresses in the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet. Configure a UDP echo server on the AP and a UDP echo client on one of the STAs to send five 512-byte packets at 1-second intervals. The simulation should run for 10 seconds.
