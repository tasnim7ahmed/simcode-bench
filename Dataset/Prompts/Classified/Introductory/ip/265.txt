Generate an NS-3 C++ simulation script for a Wi-Fi network in infrastructure mode. The network should have one access point (AP) and two station (STA) nodes using the 802.11n standard. The AP and STAs should have unique IPv4 addresses in the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet. The AP should run a UDP echo server on port 9, while one STA should act as a client sending five packets of 512 bytes each. The nodes should be placed in a grid layout, and the simulation should run for 10 seconds.
