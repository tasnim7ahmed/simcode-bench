Generate an NS-3 C++ simulation script for a simple LTE cellular network with a single cell. The network should consist of one eNodeB (base station) and one User Equipment (UE). The eNodeB and UE should have unique IPv4 addresses in the 10.1.1.0/24 subnet. The UE should move using the RandomWalk2dMobilityModel within a bounded area (-50, 50, -50, 50). A UDP echo server should run on the UE node on port 9, while the eNodeB node acts as the client sending ten packets of 512 bytes each. The simulation should run for 10 seconds.
