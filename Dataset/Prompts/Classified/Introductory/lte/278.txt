Generate an NS-3 C++ simulation script for a simple LTE network with one eNodeB and one User Equipment (UE). The eNodeB should be static, while the UE should move randomly within a 50x50 area using the Random Walk mobility model. Set up a basic LTE communication system with IP address assignment and install applications for HTTP communication. The eNodeB should have a UDP server running on port 80, and the UE should act as an HTTP client, sending 5 packets at 1-second intervals. The simulation should run for 10 seconds.
