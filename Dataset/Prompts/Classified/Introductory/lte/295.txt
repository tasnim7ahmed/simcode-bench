Generate an NS-3 C++ script to simulate an LTE network with one eNodeB (base station) and one UE (user equipment). The eNodeB and UE should communicate using the LTE interface. Set up a UDP server on the UE and a UDP client on the eNodeB, with a data transfer interval of 100ms and a packet size of 1024 bytes. The simulation should run for 10 seconds. The eNodeB should be stationary, and the UE should have random mobility.
