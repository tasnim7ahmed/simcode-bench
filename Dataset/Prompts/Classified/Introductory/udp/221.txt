Write an NS-3 simulation in C++ where a client communicates with multiple servers using UDP. The client should send packets to two different servers at regular intervals. Each server should listen on a different port and log the received packets. Set up a simple point-to-point network where the client is connected to both servers via a switch (CSMA network). Implement custom UDP socket applications instead of using NS-3â€™s built-in UdpEchoClient and UdpEchoServer. The simulation should run for 10 seconds.
