Write an NS-3 simulation in C++ where a sensor network communicates using UDP over a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). The network consists of multiple sensor nodes that periodically send data to a central sink node. The nodes should use the OLSR (Optimized Link State Routing) protocol for efficient data routing. The simulation should include an energy model for sensor nodes and run for 50 seconds.
