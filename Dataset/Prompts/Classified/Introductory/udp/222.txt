Write an NS-3 simulation in C++ where a UDP client communicates with a server over a wireless (Wi-Fi) network. The client should send packets to the server at regular intervals, and the server should log the received packets. Configure a Wi-Fi network using the infrastructure mode (where the client connects to an access point, and the server is also connected to the access point). Use custom UDP socket applications instead of NS-3â€™s built-in UdpEchoClient and UdpEchoServer. The simulation should run for 10 seconds.
