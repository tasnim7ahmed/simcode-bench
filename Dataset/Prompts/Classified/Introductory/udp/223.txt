Write an NS-3 simulation in C++ where a UDP client communicates with a server over an ad-hoc Wi-Fi network. The client should send packets to the server at regular intervals, and the server should log the received packets. Configure a Wi-Fi ad-hoc network where both the client and server communicate directly without an access point. Implement custom UDP socket applications instead of using NS-3â€™s built-in UdpEchoClient and UdpEchoServer. The simulation should run for 10 seconds
