Generate an NS-3 C++ script to set up a simple WiFi network with one Station (STA) and one Access Point (AP). The STA should run a UDP client on port 9, and the AP should run a UDP server. The STA sends 1,000 UDP packets of 1024 bytes each, with a packet interval of 0.01 seconds. The simulation should run for 10 seconds, with the server starting at 1 second and the client starting at 2 seconds.
