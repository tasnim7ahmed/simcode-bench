Generate an NS-3 C++ simulation script for a Wi-Fi network with one Access Point (AP) and three Client Stations (STA). The AP should be static, and the STAs should move randomly within a 50x50 area using the Random Walk mobility model. Set up the Wi-Fi devices with a common SSID and assign IP addresses. The AP should have a UDP server running on port 9, and the STAs should act as UDP clients, sending 5 packets at 1-second intervals. The simulation should run for 10 seconds.
