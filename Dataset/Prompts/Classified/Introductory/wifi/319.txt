Generate an NS-3 C++ script that creates a Wi-Fi network with one Access Point (AP) and three stations (STA). The AP runs a UDP server on port 9, and the stations act as UDP clients. The UDP clients send 1,000 UDP packets of 1024 bytes each with an interval of 0.01 seconds. The simulation runs for 10 seconds, with the server starting at 1 second and the clients starting at 2 seconds.
