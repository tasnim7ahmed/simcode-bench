Generate an NS-3 C++ simulation script for a Wi-Fi network with one Access Point (AP) and three stations (STAs). The AP should be static, while the STAs should be placed in a grid layout. Use the IEEE 802.11n 5GHz standard for Wi-Fi. Set the IP address for the STAs and the AP. Create a Simplex UDP server on the AP and Simplex UDP clients on the STAs, where each STA sends five 512-byte packets at 1-second intervals to the AP. The simulation should run for 10 seconds.
