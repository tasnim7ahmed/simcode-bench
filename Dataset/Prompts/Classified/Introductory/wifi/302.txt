Generate an NS-3 C++ script that sets up a Wi-Fi network with one access point (AP) and two stations (STA) using the 802.11g standard. The network should use the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet. One STA should act as a UDP server on port 8080, while the other STA should be a UDP client sending 10 packets of 1024 bytes at 1-second intervals. The server should start at 1 second, and the client should start at 2 seconds, with the simulation running for 10 seconds.
