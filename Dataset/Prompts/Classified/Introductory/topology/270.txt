Generate an NS-3 C++ simulation script for a wireless mesh network using the IEEE 802.11s standard. The network should consist of three mesh nodes configured with the ns-3 MeshHelper using the Dot11s stack. Nodes should be arranged in a grid layout with 5-meter spacing. Each node should have an IP address in the 10.1.1.0/24 subnet. The last node should act as a UDP echo server on port 9, while the first node should be a UDP echo client sending five packets of 512 bytes each. The simulation should run for 10 seconds.
