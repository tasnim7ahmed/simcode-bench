Generate an NS-3 C++ program that creates multiple nodes and organizes them in a ring topology. The program should connect each node sequentially using Point-to-Point links and ensure that the last node connects back to the first node, forming a closed-loop structure. The program should then print confirmation of the established connections. Keep the example simple, focusing only on node creation and topology setup.
