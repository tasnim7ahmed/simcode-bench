Generate an NS-3 C++ program that creates multiple nodes and organizes them in a tree topology. The program should have a single root node, a set of intermediate nodes, and leaf nodes, with each parent connecting to its children using Point-to-Point links. The program should then print confirmation of the established connections. Keep the example simple, focusing only on node creation and topology setup.
