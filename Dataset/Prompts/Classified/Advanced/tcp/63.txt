Generate a C++ program using the NS-3 simulator that sets up a simple point-to-point network topology with two nodes, `n0` and `n1`, connected by a 500 Kbps link with a 5 ms delay. The application on node `n0` should use a `BulkSendApplication` to send data to node `n1`, which uses a `PacketSinkApplication` to receive the data. The user should be able to enable packet tracing and choose whether to use nanosecond timestamps for the pcap trace file via command-line options. The pcap trace should be written to a file named "tcp-pcap-nanosec-example.pcap". Ensure that IP addresses are assigned, the internet stack is installed, and the simulation runs for 10 seconds.
