Generate a program that simulates a network topology based on the description in Figure 17 of the paper "Data Center TCP (DCTCP)" by Mohammad Alizadeh et al. The topology should include two bottlenecks: the interface between switches T1 and T2 (30 senders over a 10 Gbps link) and the T2-R1 link (20 senders over a 1 Gbps link). Use RED queues configured for ECN marking at the bottlenecks. The program should stagger 40 TCP flows during a one-second startup window, and measure throughput during a one-second interval after a three-second convergence time. It should output throughput per flow, aggregate fairness, and queue statistics, as described.
