Generate an ns-3 simulation that sets up a simple network with two nodes connected via a point-to-point link. Install the TCP/IP stack on both nodes, and assign IP addresses to the devices. On one node, configure a TCP server that listens on port 8080. On the other node, configure a TCP client that sends packets to the server using the OnOffApplication with a constant data rate of 5Mbps and a packet size of 1024 bytes. Set the client to start transmitting after 2 seconds and stop at 10 seconds. Enable the FlowMonitor to collect network performance statistics like transmitted and received packets, and throughput. Run the simulation for 10 seconds and print out the flow statistics at the end.
