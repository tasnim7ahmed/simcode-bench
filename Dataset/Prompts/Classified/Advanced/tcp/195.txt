Simulate a wired network with a TCP bulk transfer between two nodes in ns-3. Create a point-to-point link between the nodes with configurable data rate and delay. Implement a TCP bulk send application that sends data from the client to the server. Track and log the number of bytes transmitted and the throughput during the simulation. Enable pcap tracing to capture packets transmitted over the link for detailed analysis.
