Simulate a simple star topology network using ns-3, where a central server communicates with multiple client nodes. The communication protocol used is TCP, and each client sends a series of data packets to the server. Measure the throughput, latency, and packet loss, and visualize the simulation using NetAnim. The network consists of one central server and 5 clients connected through point-to-point links.
