Simulate a point-to-point network in NS-3 where Node A acts as a TCP server and Node B acts as a TCP client. Node A and Node B are connected via a point-to-point link. Enable pcap and ASCII tracing to monitor the packet exchanges. Measure the throughput and ensure that the TCP traffic flows over the link without errors. Configure a delay of 2ms and a data rate of 5 Mbps for the point-to-point link.
