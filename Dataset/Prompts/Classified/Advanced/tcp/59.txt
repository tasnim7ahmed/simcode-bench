Write a C++ program using ns-3 to simulate a network with two nodes (n0 and n1) connected by a point-to-point link with 500 Kbps bandwidth and 5ms delay. Install a BulkSendApplication on node n0 to send data to node n1 over TCP, and a PacketSinkApplication on node n1 to receive the data. Set the simulation time to 10 seconds and allow the user to specify the maximum bytes to send and whether to enable tracing. If tracing is enabled, generate an ASCII trace file named 'tcp-bulk-send.tr' and a pcap file. Finally, print the total bytes received by the sink.
