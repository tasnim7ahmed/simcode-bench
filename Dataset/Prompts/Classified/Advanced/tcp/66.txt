Generate a C++ code implementation for the TCP Westwood(+) protocol in ns-3. The code should import necessary ns-3 modules like applications-module, core-module, and internet-module, among others. It should define congestion window, slow start threshold, RTT, and RTO tracing mechanisms using maps and output streams, connecting them to relevant TCP properties. Include functions to trace and log TCP performance metrics such as congestion window, slow start threshold, RTT, RTO, and in-flight bytes. Ensure the code includes commands for setting simulation parameters like bandwidth, delay, packet error rate, and TCP variant selection, with appropriate helper functions to configure the network topology, install applications, and set up tracing for multiple flows.
