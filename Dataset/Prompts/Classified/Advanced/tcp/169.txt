Simulate a simple point-to-point (P2P) network in ns-3 where a TCP client communicates with a TCP server. The link should have a data rate of 5 Mbps and a delay of 2 milliseconds. The TCP client should send data to the server using a bulk send application, and the server should use a packet sink to receive data. Enable pcap tracing to log packet transmissions and receptions. Run the simulation for 10 seconds and observe the throughput at the server.
