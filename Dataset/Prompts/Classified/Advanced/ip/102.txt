Write a C++ script using the ns-3 simulation library to simulate a simple network topology with five nodes (A, B, C, D, E), where node A broadcasts packets using multicast to the other nodes through a static routing setup. The nodes are connected through simple net devices, and specific links between nodes are blacklisted to control the flow of packets. Set up packet sinks on nodes B, C, D, and E to receive packets sent from node A. The script should configure multicast routing, handle packet transmission using an OnOffHelper for UDP traffic, and output packet statistics at the end of the simulation. Ensure pcap tracing and a simulation run with defined packet size and data rate.
