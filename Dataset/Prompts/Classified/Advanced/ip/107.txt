Generate a C++ program using the ns-3 library that simulates an IPv6 network topology with two segments. The network consists of three nodes (Src, n0, r, n1, Dst), where the link between `n0` and `r` has an MTU of 5000, and the link between `r` and `n1` has an MTU of 1500. Set up a CSMA network, install IPv6 internet stacks, assign IPv6 addresses, and enable forwarding and routing. Implement UDP echo client-server applications, sending packets from `n0` to `n1` through the router. Enable tracing of queues and packet receptions to a file named 'fragmentation-ipv6-two-mtu.tr'.
