Create a C++ program using the ns-3 library to simulate a network topology featuring two routers (R1, R2) and two station nodes (STA1, STA2). Implement the following configuration: STA1 uses R1 as its default route, R1 has a static route to STA2 via R2, and STA2 uses R2 as its default route. Have STA1 send an Echo Request to STA2 through R1, which forwards it to R2. Afterward, R1 sends an ICMPv6 Redirection message to STA1, indicating that future Echo Requests to STA2 should go directly to R2. Include tracing of packet flows to a file named 'icmpv6-redirect.tr'.
