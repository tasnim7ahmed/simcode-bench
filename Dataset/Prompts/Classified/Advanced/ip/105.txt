Generate a C++ program using the ns-3 library that simulates a simple IPv6 network topology with three nodes: two end nodes (n0 and n1) connected via a router (r). Configure CSMA channels between the nodes with specified data rate and delay. Install an IPv6 Internet stack on all nodes and assign IPv6 addresses with appropriate forwarding and default routes. Create a UDP echo client-server application where n0 sends fragmented packets to n1 through the router. Enable logging for key components, and save traces of queue and packet reception events to a file named 'fragmentation-ipv6.tr'. Additionally, capture packet traces using pcap.
