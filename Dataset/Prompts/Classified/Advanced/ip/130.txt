Simulate a private network using Network Address Translation (NAT) in NS-3. The private network contains two hosts using private IP addresses. A NAT router connects this private network to a public network, where an external server is located. The hosts in the private network send UDP packets to the public server, and the NAT router translates their private IP addresses to a public IP for outbound traffic. Capture and verify that the public server responds to the NAT router's public IP, and the NAT router translates the responses back to the correct private IP addresses.
