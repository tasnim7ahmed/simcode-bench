Write a C++ program using the ns-3 simulation library to model a network topology with multiple hosts and routers, including Host 0, Host 1, Router 0, Router 1, Router 2, and Router 3. Configure the network so that Host 0 communicates with Host 1 through a series of routers using loose source routing. Ensure that the program sets up the necessary connections between the nodes, assigns IPv6 addresses, and configures routing appropriately. Implement ICMPv6 echo requests from Host 0 to Host 1, using specified routers in the source routing process. Additionally, set up packet tracing to a file named 'loose-routing-ipv6.tr'.
