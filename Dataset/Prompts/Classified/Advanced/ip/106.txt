Generate a C++ program using the ns-3 library that simulates a multi-router IPv6 network with three segments. The network consists of five nodes (Src, n0, r1, n1, r2, n2) connected via routers with varying MTU sizes (5000, 2000, 1500). Use CSMA and Point-to-Point channels, setting the respective MTU values for each link. Install IPv6 internet stacks, configure forwarding and default routes, and set up UDP echo client-server applications between the nodes. Ensure that packet fragmentation occurs due to varying MTUs. Enable logging and tracing of packet receptions to the file 'fragmentation-ipv6-PMTU.tr'.
