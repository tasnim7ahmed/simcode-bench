Generate a C++ program using the ns-3 library to simulate a multi-interface host with static routing. The network topology should include a source node connected to two routers (Rtr1 and Rtr2) through point-to-point links, and both routers connected to a destination router, which is further connected to a destination node. Assign unique subnets for each link, and use static routing to control the path traffic takes through the network. The simulation should use TCP sockets to send traffic from the source to the destination, specifying different paths explicitly for each transmission.
