Write a C++ script using the ns-3 library to simulate a basic network topology with three nodes (n0, r, n1) where n0 and n1 are connected through a router (r) using IPv6. Set up the nodes with an IPv6 internet stack, and connect them using CSMA channels with a specified data rate and delay. Assign IPv6 addresses to the network interfaces and configure forwarding and default routes on the router. Include a ping application on n0 to send ICMPv6 echo requests to n1, and enable ASCII and pcap tracing to log the simulation to a file. Print the IPv6 routing table of node n0.
