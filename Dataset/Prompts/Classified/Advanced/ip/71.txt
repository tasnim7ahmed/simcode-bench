Write a program in ns-3 that simulates a three-router network scenario using global routing. The topology includes three nodes: A, B, and C. Node A has a /32 IP address (a.a.a.a/32), node B connects to both A and C through point-to-point links with subnets x.x.x.0/30 and y.y.y.0/30, and node C has a /32 IP address (c.c.c.c/32). Establish point-to-point links between A and B, and between B and C, each with a data rate of 5 Mbps and 2 ms delay. Add CsmaNetDevices to nodes A and C, assigning /32 IP addresses (172.16.1.1 and 192.168.1.1) to their interfaces. Set up UDP traffic from A to C, with a sending application on A and a packet sink on C, using a constant rate. Enable tracing and packet capturing for analysis.
