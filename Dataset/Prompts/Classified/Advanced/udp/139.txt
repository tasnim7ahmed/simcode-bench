Create a C++ program using ns-3 to simulate a UDP Echo Client and Server for six nodes. Set up five point-to-point links: one between node 0 and node 1, another between node 1 and node 2, one between node 2 and node 3, one between node 3 and node 4, and the last one between node 4 and node 5. All links should have a data rate of 5Mbps and a delay of 2ms. The client on node 0 should send UDP packets to the server on node 5, with nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 acting as routers. Ensure proper routing and log packet transmission and reception during the simulation.
