Generate a C++ program using ns-3 to simulate a simple UDP Echo Client with one node. The program should configure a point-to-point connection, set up an echo server, and have a client on the same node send packets to the server using the UDP protocol. The simulation should log packet transmissions and reception. Set a simple scenario with a 5Mbps link, 2ms delay, and include packet size and interval configuration
