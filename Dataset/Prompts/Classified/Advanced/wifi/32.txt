Provide code that validates the NIST, YANS, and Table-based error rate models for HE (High Efficiency) rates in NS-3. The program should output Gnuplot plots of Frame Success Rate versus Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) for each error rate model and for every HE MCS value. The code should allow configuration of frame size and iterate through a range of SNR values while generating the corresponding datasets for plotting.
