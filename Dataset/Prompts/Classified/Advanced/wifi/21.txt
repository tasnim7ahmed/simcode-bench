Create an NS-3 simulation that conducts an experiment to analyze the performance of WiFi clear channel conditions under different data rates using the 802.11b standard. Implement an `Experiment` class to handle the setup and execution of the experiment, including methods for traffic generation, packet reception, and node positioning. In the `main` function, set up a loop to test various transmission modes, configure the WiFi helper and PHY layer parameters, and simulate the effects of different received signal strengths on packet reception. Finally, collect the results in a Gnuplot dataset and generate a visual output in EPS format, showing the relationship between RSS and the number of packets received.
