Write a C++ program using ns-3 that simulates two hidden stations in an 802.11n Wi-Fi network with MPDU aggregation support. The simulation should allow the user to specify whether RTS/CTS is enabled and control the number of aggregated MPDUs via command-line arguments. The program should set up a network topology with one access point (AP) and two stations (n1 and n2), where the stations are hidden from each other due to limited wireless range. The payload size, simulation time, and expected throughput bounds can also be adjusted via command-line arguments. The stations send UDP traffic to the AP, and the simulation logs throughput and generates trace files (PCAP and ASCII).
