Write a complete NS-3 simulation script in C++ that models a WiFi network with two Access Points (APs) and two Station (STA) nodes, where positions of APs and STAs are configurable via command-line arguments. The nodes should be positioned using a `ListPositionAllocator`. Configure the WiFi network using `WifiHelper`, `YansWifiPhyHelper`, and `YansWifiChannelHelper` with the 802.11a standard, different SSIDs for each AP-STA pair, and allow adjustment of RTS/CTS thresholds and transmission power levels. Use `ns3::ParfWifiManager` as the default WiFi manager, with an option to change it through the command line. Install a `PacketSink` on each STA to receive UDP traffic, and generate constant bit rate (CBR) UDP streams from each AP to its STA using `OnOffHelper`, with traffic rate set to 54 Mbps for a simulation duration of 100 seconds. Implement a `NodeStatistics` class to track WiFi state times (`CCA_BUSY`, `IDLE`, `TX`, `RX`), total bytes received, average transmit power, and calculate throughput and other metrics, printing results every second. Plot results using Gnuplot to show throughput, average transmit power, and time spent in various WiFi states. Additionally, utilize `FlowMonitor` to calculate and display flow statistics such as throughput, delay, and jitter for each AP-STA pair. Ensure the script is modular, with appropriate helper functions, and accepts command-line arguments to modify parameters like WiFi manager, RTS/CTS threshold, transmission power levels, and simulation time. Run the simulation for 100 seconds and stop execution at the end.
