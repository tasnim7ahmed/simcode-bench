Write a C++ program using the ns-3 simulation library to model a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) with two nodes communicating over an IEEE 802.15.4 network. Implement ICMPv6 echo requests and replies between the nodes, utilizing DropTail queues. Create a simulation environment where both nodes are stationary, and assign them specific IPv6 addresses within a defined prefix. Log the details of the packet flows and create a trace file named 'wsn-ping6.tr' for analyzing queue behavior and packet receptions. Include necessary headers and enable verbose logging for debugging the simulation process.
