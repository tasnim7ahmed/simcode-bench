Write a simulation program for ns-3 to illustrate rate-adaptive Wi-Fi controls like Minstrel in a scenario with two nodes: an AP and a STA. The AP sends UDP traffic to the STA using a CBR of 400 Mbps. The AP can use any power or rate control, while the STA uses Minstrel for rate adaptation. The simulation should allow the STA to move away from the AP, with distance steps and time intervals adjustable via command-line arguments. Collect statistics such as throughput and distance, and log rate changes if logging is enabled. Output a Gnuplot file showing throughput versus distance.
