Generate code that validates NIST, YANS, and Table-based error rate models for VHT (Very High Throughput) rates in NS-3. The program should calculate and plot the Frame Success Rate versus Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) for all VHT MCS values, excluding MCS 9 for 20 MHz channels, for each error rate model. The output should include separate plots using Gnuplot for each mode, and the frame size should be configurable through command-line input. SNR should range from -5 dB to 30 dB.
