Provide code for a simple NS-3 simulation that configures an IEEE 802.11n Wi-Fi network with multiple Traffic Operation Set (TOS) values. The simulation should allow the user to specify the number of stations, HT MCS value (0 to 7), channel width (20 or 40 MHz), guard interval (long or short), distance between stations and the access point, and whether RTS/CTS is used. The code should calculate and output the aggregated UDP throughput based on these parameters.
