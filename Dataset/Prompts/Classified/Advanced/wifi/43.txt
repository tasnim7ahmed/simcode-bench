Write a C++ program using ns-3 that simulates an 802.11n Wi-Fi network with MPDU aggregation support, consisting of an access point (AP) and two hidden stations. Allow the user to configure options for RTS/CTS, the number of aggregated MPDUs, payload size, simulation time, and expected throughput via command-line arguments. Set up the simulation to limit the wireless range to 5 meters, ensuring a hidden node scenario, and use UDP traffic with saturated flow from the stations to the AP. The program should generate PCAP and ASCII trace files, calculate throughput, and verify it against the user-specified bounds.
