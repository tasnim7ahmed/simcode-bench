Generate code that validates NIST, YANS, and Table-based error rate models for HE (High Efficiency) rates in NS-3. The program should generate Gnuplot plots of Frame Success Rate versus Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) for each error rate model and for all HE MCS values. It should iterate over SNR values, compute the frame success rate for each mode and model, and output the results as Gnuplot datasets. The frame size should also be configurable via command-line arguments.
