Generate an NS-3 code that simulates a Wi-Fi network with backward compatibility between different 802.11 versions, where the access point (AP) and station (STA) use different Wi-Fi standards. Include a function that converts Wi-Fi version strings like "80211a" or "80211ac" into a corresponding Wi-Fi standard and physical band. Configure the AP and STA to use separate Wi-Fi standards, assign rate adaptation algorithms, and set up traffic generation from either the AP, STA, or both. The simulation should output the throughput and include node mobility, IP addressing, UDP server and client setup, and global routing table population.
