Create simple simulation of an IEEE 802.11n Wi-Fi network using the NS-3 simulator. The program should configure the network to evaluate the goodput for different Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) values (from 0 to 7), varying channel widths (20 or 40 MHz), and guard intervals (short or long). It should allow the user to configure parameters like the simulation time, UDP or TCP mode, RTS/CTS, distance between the station and access point, and expected throughput.
