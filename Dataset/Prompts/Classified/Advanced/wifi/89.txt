Generate a C++ simulation script for NS-3 that models an energy-efficient wireless communication system with two nodes. One node transmits packets every second to the other node for 10 seconds. Both nodes are powered by a basic energy source, and each is connected to a basic energy harvester. The script should set the initial energy of each node to 1 joule, and the WiFi radio should consume energy for packet transmission and reception, with transmission and reception currents set to 0.0174A and 0.0197A, respectively. The harvester provides a random power between 0 and 0.1 watts, updated every second. Track and log energy consumption, harvested power, and residual energy for the receiver node during the simulation. Each packet takes 0.0023 seconds to transmit, and the simulation should print energy statistics upon completion.
