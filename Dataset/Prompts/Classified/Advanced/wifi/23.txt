Create a simulation of a Wi-Fi environment using NS-3 to evaluate throughput for different Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) values, channel widths, and guard intervals (GI) under the IEEE 802.11be (Wi-Fi 7) standard. The program should accept input parameters such as MCS, operating frequencies (2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, or 6 GHz), uplink OFDMA and BSRP flags, number of stations, traffic type (TCP or UDP), payload size, MPDU buffer size, and auxiliary PHY settings. For each combination of MCS, channel width, and GI, the simulation must create Wi-Fi stations and access points, configure them with the specified frequencies, and evaluate data throughput based on available bandwidth per station. The simulation should test both TCP and UDP traffic, run for a specified time, and print the results. Multiple frequencies (2.4, 5, and 6 GHz) should be configured correctly, ensuring they are unique to prevent collisions. Throughput tests should gather cumulative RX bytes per station and validate results against minimum and maximum expected throughput values, with a tolerance to account for real-world variances. If any throughput result is unexpectedly low or high for any MCS, channel width, or GI combination, an error should be logged, and the simulation should terminate. The output must display a table showing the MCS value, channel width, guard interval, and calculated throughput in Mbps.
