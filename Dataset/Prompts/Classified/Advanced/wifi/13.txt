Write me a code that simulates a mixed wired and wireless network topology using ns-3. The network should consist of multiple backbone routers connected by an ad hoc WiFi network, with each backbone router having a local 802.11 infrastructure network and being connected to a local LAN. The nodes should use TCP/IP stacks, with OLSR routing on the backbone network. There should be a UDP flow from a wired LAN node to a wireless STA in the last infrastructure network. Ensure the simulation parameters like number of backbone routers, LAN nodes, and wireless nodes can be configured via command line arguments. Additionally, set up mobility for the nodes, and configure options to generate packet traces and enable course change callbacks for the mobility models.
