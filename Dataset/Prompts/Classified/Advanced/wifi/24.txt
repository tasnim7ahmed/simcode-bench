You will create a simulation in NS-3 to demonstrate the differences between the Nist, Yans, and Table-based error rate models. This program will generate plots comparing the Frame Error Rate (FER) to the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) for MCS values 0, 4, and 7. You will use the `Gnuplot` library to visualize the data. The simulation accepts command-line parameters such as frame size, MCS range, step values, and error model flags. You will configure and test different MCS values across a range of SNR values and calculate the FER for each error model. The results will be plotted, with Nist, Yans, and Table-based error rate models differentiated by color. After running the simulation, you will output a plot in `.eps` format showing the performance of each error model across the tested MCS values and SNR range.
