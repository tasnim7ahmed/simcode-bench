Write a program in C++ using the ns-3 library that reads an upper triangular adjacency matrix from a file (e.g., `adjacency_matrix.txt`) and node coordinates from a file (e.g., `node_coordinates.txt`). The program should set up a wired network topology with point-to-point (P2P) links according to the adjacency matrix and establish constant bit rate (CBR) traffic flows between nodes. Each node should have a unique traffic flow towards every other node, except itself, resulting in `n*(n-1)` CBR flows, where `n` is the number of nodes. The network topology, CBR traffic, and positions of nodes should be visualized in NetAnim, and simulation outputs should be logged.
