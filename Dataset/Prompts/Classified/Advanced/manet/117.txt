Create a C++ program using the ns-3 simulation library to model an ad hoc wireless network consisting of two nodes. Configure the nodes to operate with IEEE 802.11 in ad hoc mode and set the transmission power for both nodes to 50.0 dBm. Implement a mobility model where the nodes move randomly within defined rectangular boundaries. Install the Internet stack and assign IPv4 addresses from the subnet 192.9.39.0/24 to the nodes. Establish UDP echo server applications on both nodes, enabling bidirectional communication where each node sends echo requests to the other with a maximum of 50 packets sent at half-second intervals. Integrate a flow monitor to capture network statistics, including packet delivery ratios, end-to-end delays, and throughput. Generate an animation file to visualize the network activity during the simulation. Finally, output the collected flow statistics and performance metrics after running the simulation.
