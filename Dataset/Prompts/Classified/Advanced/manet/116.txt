Write a C++ program using the ns-3 simulation library to model an ad hoc wireless network with two nodes. Configure the nodes to use the IEEE 802.11 protocol in ad hoc mode and set up a mobility model where nodes move randomly within defined boundaries. Install the Internet stack on the nodes and assign IPv4 addresses from the subnet 192.9.39.0/24. Implement UDP echo server and client applications on both nodes to facilitate bidirectional communication, allowing each node to send echo requests to the other. Incorporate flow monitoring to capture network statistics, including packet delivery ratios, end-to-end delays, and throughput. Generate an animation file to visualize the network activity during the simulation. Finally, output the collected flow statistics and performance metrics after running the simulation.
