Create an ns-3 simulation for a wireless network where four mobile nodes are connected via an Ad-Hoc network. Use the AODV (Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector) routing protocol to manage routing in the network. The nodes should move randomly within a predefined area during the simulation, and UDP traffic is generated between the nodes. Track the movement and interactions of the nodes using NetAnim. Measure and analyze packet delivery ratio, throughput, and average end-to-end delay using FlowMonitor, and visualize the nodes' mobility and communication using NetAnim.
