Generate a C++ program using NS-3 that creates a basic point-to-point network with two nodes connected by a point-to-point link. Assign IP addresses to the nodes, set up a UDP communication between them, and enable packet tracing. Finally, generate a NetAnim XML trace file for visualizing the network simulation. The animation should include node positions and packet transmission animations.
