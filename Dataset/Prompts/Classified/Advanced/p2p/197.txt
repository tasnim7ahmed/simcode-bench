Simulate a basic wired network using ns-3, where three nodes are connected in a simple point-to-point (P2P) topology. The first node sends TCP traffic to the third node, while the second node acts as a router forwarding packets between them. Implement packet tracing to log the number of transmitted and received packets on each node. Capture and analyze the packets in a pcap file for deeper analysis.
