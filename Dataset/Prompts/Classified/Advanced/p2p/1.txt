Create an NS-3 simulation in C++ that models a simple point-to-point network consisting of two nodes connected directly to each other. The link between the nodes should have a data transmission rate of 5 Mbps and a propagation delay of 2 milliseconds. The nodes should use standard Internet protocols for communication. Assign IP addresses to both nodes, and configure one node to act as a UDP echo server listening on port 9, while the other node should act as a UDP echo client. The server should start at 1 second and stop at 10 seconds, while the client should start at 2 seconds, sending a single 1024-byte message to the server. After receiving the message, the server should send the message back to the client. Additionally, capture the network traffic in a `.pcap` file for analysis. The simulation should run for 10 seconds, concluding after all messages are exchanged.
