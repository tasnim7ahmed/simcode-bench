Simulate a simple point-to-point network with two nodes using ns-3. Configure the first node to act as a sender and the second node as a receiver. Use TCP as the transport protocol, and set up a bulk data transfer application on the sender to continuously send data to the receiver. Enable packet tracing to generate pcap files for traffic analysis, and log the total amount of data received at the end of the simulation.
