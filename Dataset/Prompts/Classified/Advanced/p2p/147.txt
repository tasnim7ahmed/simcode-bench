Write a simple C++ program using the ns-3 simulation library to set up a branch topology with three nodes. Configure the nodes to communicate using a point-to-point network where node 0 acts as the central node connected to nodes 1 and 2 via separate links. Use UDP traffic to generate communication between the nodes, and assign IP addresses accordingly. The simulation should run for 10 seconds, and PCAP tracing should be enabled for traffic analysis.
