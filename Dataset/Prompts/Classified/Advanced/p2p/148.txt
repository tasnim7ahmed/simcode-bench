Write a C++ program using the ns-3 simulation library to set up a branch topology with four nodes. Node 0 acts as the central node, with point-to-point links connecting it to nodes 1, 2, and 3. Configure UDP traffic so that nodes 1, 2, and 3 send traffic to node 0, and assign unique IP addresses to each network segment. Enable PCAP tracing to capture the traffic, and run the simulation for 10 seconds.
