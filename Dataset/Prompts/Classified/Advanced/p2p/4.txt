Write a C++ program using NS-3 that creates two network nodes and connects them using a point-to-point link. The link should have a data transmission rate of 5 Mbps and a propagation delay of 2 milliseconds. Install the Internet stack on both nodes, which includes the IP protocol, and assign IP addresses to the devices using the address range "10.1.1.0/24". The goal is to ensure that the nodes are correctly assigned IP addresses, but there is no need to implement any communication between them. Finally, run and destroy the simulation.
