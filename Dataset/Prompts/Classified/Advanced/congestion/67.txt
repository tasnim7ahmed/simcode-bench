Write C++ code for a network simulation using ns-3 that builds a dumbbell topology with 7 senders and 1 receiver. The script should simulate both TCP and UDP traffic over a Point-to-Point link with different queue disciplines (COBALT and CoDel). Implement a congestion window trace for TCP and a queue size trace for each queue disc, saving the results in separate files. Ensure the simulation stops after a specified time and use helper classes for devices, links, and addressing. The code should include necessary ns-3 modules and implement the `experiment` function to run the simulation twice with the different queue discs.
