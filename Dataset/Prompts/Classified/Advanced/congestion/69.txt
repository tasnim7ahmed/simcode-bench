Write a C++ program using the ns-3 network simulator that sets up a dumbbell topology with configurable parameters for the number of leaf nodes, queue types (either RED or Feng's Adaptive RED), and other network settings such as packet size and data rates. The program should use command-line arguments to adjust parameters like the number of packets allowed in the queue, packet size, data rate, and RED queue thresholds. Include default settings for RED queue parameters, link bandwidth, and delay, and install a TCP OnOff application on all right-side nodes with a uniform random variable for On/Off times. The simulation should display the final queue disc statistics and check for expected packet drops.
