Create an ns-3 simulation that models a hybrid topology combining a **star topology** and a **bus topology**. In the star topology, a central node (Node 0) is connected to three peripheral nodes (Nodes 1, 2, and 3) using point-to-point links. In the bus topology, three nodes (Nodes 4, 5, and 6) are connected sequentially with point-to-point links. Install the **Internet stack** on all nodes and assign appropriate **IP addresses**. Deploy a **UDP echo server** on Node 0 (central node in the star topology) and **UDP echo clients** on Nodes 4 and 5 from the bus topology. Use **FlowMonitor** to track performance metrics such as packet loss and delay, and run the simulation for 20 seconds.
