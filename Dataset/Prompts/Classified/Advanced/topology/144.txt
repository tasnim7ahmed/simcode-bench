Create a C++ simulation using ns-3 to simulate a ring topology with 4 nodes. In this configuration, each node is connected to two other nodes, forming a closed loop. Use point-to-point links with a data rate of 5Mbps and a delay of 1ms. Install the Internet stack, assign IP addresses, and simulate packet transmission in a circular fashion, where each node sends packets to its neighbor. Log the packet transmissions to observe the behavior of the network.
