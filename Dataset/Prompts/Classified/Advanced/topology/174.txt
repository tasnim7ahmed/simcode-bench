Create an ns-3 simulation that demonstrates a hybrid topology combining a ring, mesh, bus, line, star, and tree topology. This simulation will show the interconnection of nodes in different topology types within a single network. Use point-to-point links for connections, install Internet stacks on the nodes, and enable dynamic routing using OSPF for efficient routing between nodes. Additionally, enable tracing and NetAnim visualization to capture the network behavior
