Write a C++ program using the ns-3 simulator to create a mixed point-to-point and CSMA/CD network. The topology should include seven nodes, where two point-to-point links connect nodes n0 to n2 and n1 to n2, while nodes n2, n3, n4, and n5 form a shared CSMA/CD segment. Another point-to-point link connects n5 and n6. Implement a CBR/UDP flow from n0 to n6, and configure the OnOff application to send UDP packets of 50 bytes at a rate of 300 bps. Trace the network queues and packet receptions to a file, and enable pcap tracing for all channels.
