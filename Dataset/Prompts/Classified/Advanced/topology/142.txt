Create a C++ simulation using ns-3 to simulate a star topology with 3 nodes. There should be a central node connected to 2 other nodes with point-to-point links. Set the link data rate to 5Mbps and delay to 1ms. Install the Internet stack, assign IP addresses, and simulate packet transmission between the peripheral nodes via the central node. Use logging to track packet transmissions.
