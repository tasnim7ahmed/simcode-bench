Write a C++ program using ns-3 to create a star topology network, where the central node (hub) connects to eight surrounding nodes (spokes) using point-to-point links. Install the internet stack on all nodes and assign IPv4 addresses. Set default application configurations: an OnOffApplication with a packet size of 137 bytes and a data rate of 14kbps. Create a packet sink on the hub node to receive TCP traffic on port 50000, and configure each spoke node to send TCP traffic to the hub using OnOff applications. Enable static global routing and capture pcap traces for all devices. Run the simulation for 10 seconds.
