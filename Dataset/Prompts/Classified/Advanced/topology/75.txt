Write a C++ script using the ns-3 simulation library to create a mixed point-to-point and CSMA/CD network topology. The network should include seven nodes, where n0 and n1 connect to n2 via point-to-point links, and n2, n3, n4, and n5 are connected through a shared CSMA/CD bus. Additionally, n5 and n6 are connected via a point-to-point link. Set up Constant Bit Rate (CBR) UDP traffic from n0 to n6, with packet sizes of 210 bytes and a data rate of 448 Kb/s. Enable tracing of queues and packet receptions to a trace file.
