Simulate a Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET) using DSDV (Destination-Sequenced Distance-Vector Routing) in ns-3. The simulation will model vehicles moving along a straight road, with each vehicle acting as a mobile node. These nodes communicate via WiFi and use the DSDV routing protocol to maintain routes between them. The simulation will track packet delivery, node mobility, and the overall network performance using DSDV.
