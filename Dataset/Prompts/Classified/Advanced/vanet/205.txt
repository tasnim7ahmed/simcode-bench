Simulate a vehicular network scenario using ns-3, where four vehicles are moving along a straight road. The vehicles should communicate using WiFi in ad-hoc mode. Use a constant velocity mobility model to simulate the movement of the vehicles. The vehicles should send periodic UDP packets to one another to mimic vehicle-to-vehicle communication. Collect metrics such as packet loss and delay, and visualize the simulation using NetAnim.
