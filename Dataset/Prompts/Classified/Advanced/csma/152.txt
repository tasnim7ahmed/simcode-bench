Create a C++ program using ns-3 to simulate a bus topology with 4 nodes. All nodes are connected to a shared bus network using a CSMA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access) channel. Set up a UDP Echo server on node 3 and configure node 0 to send traffic to node 3 via the shared bus. Assign IP addresses and enable PCAP tracing to capture traffic. The simulation should run for 10 seconds.
