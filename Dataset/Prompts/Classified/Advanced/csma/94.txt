Generate a C++ program using the ns-3 library to simulate a simple LAN topology with two nodes (n0 and n1) connected via a CSMA link, where n0 sends UDP packets to n1 using IPv6. The receiver (n1) should log incoming packets, including the TCLASS and HOPLIMIT values. The sender (n0) should allow setting socket options for IPv6 TCLASS and HOPLIMIT, and the receiver should be able to process RECVTCLASS and RECVHOPLIMIT options. Include command-line parameters to configure the packet size, number of packets, interval, and IPv6 socket options.
