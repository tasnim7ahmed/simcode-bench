Create a network topology in ns3 using a star-shaped configuration where each node acts as both a client and a server, similar to a ring topology. Use point-to-point links for connectivity, with the network address 192.9.39.0/24. Each client should generate 4 packets, and only one client-server pair should communicate at a time, ensuring all packets are delivered to the server. The UDP echo server and client applications should be used, with nodes sending packets at specific intervals. The central node connects to all other nodes using point-to-point links. Provide a solution that configures the IP addresses, links, and applications accordingly, ensuring that the network is animated using NetAnim. Additionally, configure the link data rate to 5Mbps and a delay of 2ms.
