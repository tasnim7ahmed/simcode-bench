Create an NS-3 simulation in C++ that sets up a network with two nodes. Install the Internet stack on these nodes and establish a point-to-point link between them with a transmission rate of 5 Mbps and a propagation delay of 2 milliseconds. Assign IP addresses from the range "10.1.1.0/24" to the devices on each node. The goal is to ensure that the Internet Protocol (IP) addresses are correctly assigned to the nodes, but no communication between the nodes is required in this simulation.
