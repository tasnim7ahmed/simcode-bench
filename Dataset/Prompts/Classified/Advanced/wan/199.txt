Simulate a network with two point-to-point links connecting three routers (R1, R2, R3) and a LAN connected to one of the routers (R2). The simulation uses the TCP protocol to send traffic from a node in the LAN to a node connected to Router R3, passing through Router R2. The simulation collects data on packet transmission, reception, and throughput, and saves this information into an output file.
