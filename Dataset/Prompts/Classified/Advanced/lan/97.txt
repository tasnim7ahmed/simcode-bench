Create a C++ program using the ns-3 library to demonstrate the use of the Object Names service with a network topology of four nodes connected by a CSMA LAN. Assign human-readable names to nodes and devices, such as "client" and "server," and demonstrate renaming nodes in the name system. Configure attributes of CSMA devices using the Object Names service and mix object names and node attributes in the configuration system. Install a UDP echo server on the named "server" node and a UDP echo client on the named "client" node, with packet tracing enabled and the use of pcap files.
