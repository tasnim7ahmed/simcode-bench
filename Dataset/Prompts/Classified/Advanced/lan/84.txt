Create a C++ program using the ns-3 network simulator to build a simple LAN (CSMA) connecting two nodes, n0 and n1. Implement a UDP flow from n0 to n1, where packets are drawn from a trace file. Provide options for using either IPv4 or IPv6 addressing and for enabling or disabling logging of the simulation events. Configure a CSMA channel between the nodes with a data rate of 5 Mbps, a delay of 2 ms, and an MTU of 1500 bytes. Start the UDP server at 1 second and the client at 2 seconds, running the simulation for a total of 10 seconds.
