Create a C++ program using the ns-3 simulation library to model a network topology featuring two nodes (n0 and n1) connected via a router (R) over a CSMA channel. Configure the router to send Router Advertisements (RAs) to n0's subnet with two prefixes: 2001:1::/64 and 2001:ABCD::/64, ensuring that the R interface to n0 has both addresses assigned. Additionally, configure the router to send RAs to n1's subnet (2001:2::/64). Implement a Ping application where n0 sends ICMPv6 echo requests to n1. Incorporate tracing of queues and packet receptions, saving the output to a file named 'radvd-two-prefix.tr'. Include appropriate logging and IP address printing functionality within the simulation.
