Write a C++ program using the ns-3 simulation library to model a network topology that includes two nodes (n0 and n1) connected through a router (R) via a CSMA channel. Configure the router to send Router Advertisements (RAs) to both n0's subnet (2001:1::/64) and n1's subnet (2001:2::/64). Implement a Ping application where n0 sends ICMPv6 echo requests to n1. Include tracing of queues and packet receptions, saving the output to a file named 'radvd.tr'. Ensure to set up the IPv6 Internet stack, assign IPv6 addresses, and configure the Radvd application appropriately.
