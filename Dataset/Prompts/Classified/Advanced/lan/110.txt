Create a C++ program using the ns-3 simulation library to model a simple network topology consisting of two nodes (n0 and n1) connected via a LAN using a CSMA channel. Implement ICMPv6 echo requests flowing from n0 to n1 and back, simulating echo replies. Configure the network with DropTail queues and set up tracing of queues and packet receptions, outputting to a file named 'ping6.tr'. Include the installation of the IPv6 stack, address assignment, and the creation of a Ping application that sends a specified number of echo requests from n0 to n1.
