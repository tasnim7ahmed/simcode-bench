Create a C++ program using ns-3 to simulate a basic TCP Socket communication between two nodes. Set up a point-to-point link between the nodes with a data rate of 5Mbps and a delay of 2ms. Use a custom TCP socket on one node to send data to another node, acting as a server, using the socket API. Log the data transmission and reception events during the simulation
