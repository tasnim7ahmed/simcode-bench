Write a C++ program using NS-3 that simulates network traffic capture between two nodes connected via a point-to-point link. Set the data transmission rate of the link to 5 Mbps and a propagation delay of 2 milliseconds. Install the Internet stack on both nodes and assign IP addresses to the devices using the range "10.1.1.0/24". Enable packet capture to record the traffic exchanged between the nodes into a .pcap file. Focus solely on capturing the network traffic, without configuring additional communication protocols or applications. Run and destroy the simulation afterward.
