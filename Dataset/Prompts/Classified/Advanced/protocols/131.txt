Simulate the "count to infinity" problem in a small network using Distance Vector (DV) routing in NS-3. The network consists of three routers (A, B, and C) connected in a triangle. Router A connects to router B, and router B connects to router C. Initially, all routers exchange routing information and establish routes. After a few seconds, the link between router B and router C is intentionally broken. Observe how routers A and C incorrectly continue to believe they can reach each other through the failed link and increment their hop counts until they reach the maximum hop count, simulating the "count to infinity" problem.
