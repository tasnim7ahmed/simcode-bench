Simulate the two-node loop problem in a network using Distance Vector (DV) routing in NS-3. The network consists of two nodes (A and B) connected to each other. Initially, the routing tables converge, and A and B can forward traffic to a common destination. After a few seconds, the network is altered to simulate a failure, and A and B begin to incorrectly forward packets to each other, creating a loop. Observe how packets circulate between A and B, demonstrating the two-node loop problem in Distance Vector routing.
