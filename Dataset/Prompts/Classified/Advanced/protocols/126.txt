Generate a C++ program using NS-3 to simulate Distance Vector Routing (DVR) in a small network. Create a simple network topology with three routers and four subnetworks, where Distance Vector Routing is used to dynamically compute the best path between nodes. The topology should include point-to-point links between the routers and allow traffic between subnetworks using the dynamic routing information generated by DVR. Also, include pcap tracing to capture the data flow and routing exchanges.
