Generate a C++ code that sets up a network topology with RIPng routing in an ns-3 simulation. The network should consist of nodes SRC, A, B, C, D, and DST. The connections are as follows: SRC connects to A, A connects to both B and C, B connects to both C and D, and D connects to DST. All links have a cost of 1, except the direct link from C to D, which has a cost of 10. The routers A and D have static addresses, and packets will be exchanged between SRC and DST. After 3 seconds, the topology is built, and ping responses are received. At 40 seconds, the link between B and D breaks, causing route failure, and recovery occurs after 44 seconds. Include Split Horizon options in the routing strategy and add pcap and ascii tracing to monitor the network behavior.
