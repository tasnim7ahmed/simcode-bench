Generate a C++ program using NS-3 that sets up a simple network with four nodes connected in a square topology. Use point-to-point links between the nodes and configure OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) as the routing protocol. Assign IP addresses to the nodes and set up UDP communication between two of the nodes. Enable packet tracing and create a pcap trace file for each point-to-point link. The network should use OSPF to dynamically find the best route for packets. Additionally, display the routing tables at the end of the simulation.
