Create a C++ program using ns-3 to simulate a simple network topology with 4 nodes using the AODV (Ad-hoc On-Demand Distance Vector) routing protocol instead of OSPF. Configure the nodes to form an ad-hoc wireless network, assign IP addresses, and set up a UDP Echo server on node 3. Node 0 should send traffic to node 3 via the AODV protocol. Enable PCAP tracing to capture the traffic and run the simulation for 10 seconds.
