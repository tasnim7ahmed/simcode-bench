Write a C++ program using the ns-3 network simulation library that defines a simple RIP routing topology. The network consists of nodes SRC and DST, connected via four routers: A, B, C, and D. Configure each router and specify that all network links have a cost of 1, except for the link between routers C and D, which has a cost of 10. Enable split horizon routing with Poison Reverse and allow command-line arguments for verbosity, routing table printing, and ping visibility. The network should simulate link failure between routers B and D at 40 seconds, followed by recovery after 44 seconds. The program should print routing tables at regular intervals and optionally display ping results.
