Simulate Split Horizon in a simple network using Distance Vector (DV) routing in NS-3. The network consists of three nodes arranged in a linear topology, where Node A is connected to Node B, and Node B is connected to Node C. Use Distance Vector routing to allow traffic to flow between the nodes. Demonstrate that the Split Horizon rule is preventing routing loops by ensuring that routes are not advertised back to the node from which they were learned.
