Generate an NS-3 C++ script to simulate a wireless network with UDP communication between a sender (STA) and a receiver (AP). The sender sends 10 UDP packets (each 1024 bytes) to the receiver on port 9. The sender moves randomly within a 100x100 mÂ² area using a random walk mobility model, while the receiver is stationary. Use the Wi-Fi 802.11n 5GHz standard, with IP addressing in the 10.1.1.0/24 range.
