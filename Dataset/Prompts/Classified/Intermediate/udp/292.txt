Generate an NS-3 C++ script simulating a 5G NR (New Radio) network with one gNB (base station) and one UE (user equipment). The gNB serves as the base station and the UE sends 512-byte UDP packets to the gNB every 500ms. The simulation should run for 10 seconds. The 5G NR module should be used for the radio access network, and the Evolved Packet Core (EPC) should be implemented for packet forwarding. Set up mobility so the gNB is stationary, and the UE sends data while moving.
