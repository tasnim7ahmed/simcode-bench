Generate an NS-3 C++ script to set up a simple 5G NR network with one User Equipment (UE), one gNB (5G base station), and the 5G Core Network (CN). The gNB should communicate with the UE using UDP. The UE should run a UDP server on port 9, and the gNB should send 1,000 UDP packets of 1024 bytes each, with a packet interval of 0.01 seconds. The simulation should run for 10 seconds, with the server starting at 1 second and the client starting at 2 seconds.
