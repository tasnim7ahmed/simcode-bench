Generate an NS-3 C++ script to simulate a Wi-Fi network with one Access Point (AP) and three Stations (STAs). A UDP server should be installed on the Access Point, and a UDP client should be installed on one of the stations. The stations should have random mobility while the Access Point remains stationary. The simulation should run for 10 seconds, and the Wi-Fi protocol should be used with AarfWifiManager. The link should have a constant position for the AP and random walk mobility for the STAs. The UDP client sends packets to the UDP server during the simulation.
