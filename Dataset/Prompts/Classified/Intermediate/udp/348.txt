Generate an NS-3 C++ script to simulate UDP communication between two nodes. One node should act as a UDP server and the other as a UDP client. Both nodes should use IPv4 addresses. The UDP server should be installed on Node 0, and the UDP client on Node 1. The client should send 10 packets of size 1024 bytes at a rate of 1 packet per second. The simulation should run for 10 seconds, with the server starting at 1 second and the client starting at 2 seconds.
