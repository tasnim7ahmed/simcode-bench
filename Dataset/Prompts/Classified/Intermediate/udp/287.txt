Generate an NS-3 C++ script simulating a 5G NR network with one gNB (base station) and two UE nodes using the mmWave module. The UEs should move randomly within a 50x50 area, while the gNB remains stationary. One UE should act as a UDP server on port 5001, while the other should be a UDP client, sending 1024-byte packets every 10ms. The simulation should run for 10 seconds, with PCAP tracing enabled.
