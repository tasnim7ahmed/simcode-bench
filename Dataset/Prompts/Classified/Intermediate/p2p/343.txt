Generate an NS-3 C++ script to simulate a Point-to-Point network with two nodes communicating using UDP. The link between the nodes should have a bandwidth of 5Mbps and a delay of 2ms. The client node (node 0) sends 10 UDP packets of 1024 bytes every 1 second to the server node (node 1) on port 9. The server (node 1) should be running an UDP echo server on port 9. The simulation should run for 10 seconds.
