Generate an NS-3 C++ script that simulates a point-to-point (P2P) wired network with two nodes communicating over a 5 Mbps link with a 2 ms delay. Node 1 should run a TCP server listening on port 50000, while Node 0 should run a TCP client using the BulkSendHelper to send unlimited data to the server. The server should start at 1 second, and the client should start at 2 seconds, both running until 10 seconds. The network should use the 10.1.1.0/24 subnet.
