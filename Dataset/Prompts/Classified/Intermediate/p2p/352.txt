Generate an NS-3 C++ script that simulates a Point-to-Point (P2P) wired network with two nodes connected via a 10 Mbps link with 2 ms delay. The first node should run a TCP client using the OnOff application, sending 1024-byte packets at a 5 Mbps data rate to the second node, which runs a TCP server. The simulation should assign IP addresses in the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet, with the server on 192.168.1.2. The server starts at 1 second, and the client starts at 2 seconds. The simulation should run for 10 seconds.
