Generate an NS-3 C++ script that simulates a Point-to-Point (P2P) network with two nodes. One node acts as a TCP server on port 8080, and the other node acts as a TCP client. The client sends 1,000 TCP packets of 1024 bytes each with an interval of 0.01 seconds. The server starts at 1 second, and the client starts at 2 seconds. The point-to-point link has a data rate of 5 Mbps and a delay of 2 ms. The simulation runs for 10 seconds.
