Generate an NS-3 C++ script to set up a simple LTE network with one User Equipment (UE), one eNodeB (base station), and the Evolved Packet Core (EPC). The eNodeB should communicate with the UE using UDP. The UE should run a UDP server on port 9, and the eNodeB should send 1,000 UDP packets of 1024 bytes each, with a packet interval of 0.01 seconds. The simulation should run for 10 seconds, with the server starting at 1 second and the client starting at 2 seconds.
