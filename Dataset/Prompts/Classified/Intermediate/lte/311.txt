Generate an NS-3 C++ script that sets up a simple LTE network with one eNodeB (LTE base station) and two UE devices. The eNodeB should be attached to both UEs. One UE (UE 0) should act as a TCP server on port 8080, and the other UE (UE 1) should act as a TCP client, sending 1,000,000 bytes of data. The server should start at 1 second, and the client should start at 2 seconds. The simulation should run for 10 seconds.
