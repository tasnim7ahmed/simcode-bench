Generate an NS-3 C++ script that sets up a simple LTE network with one eNodeB (base station) and three UEs (User Equipments). The eNodeB runs a UDP server on port 9, and the UEs act as UDP clients. The UDP clients send 1,000 UDP packets of 1024 bytes each with an interval of 0.01 seconds. The simulation runs for 10 seconds, with the server starting at 1 second and the clients starting at 2 seconds.
