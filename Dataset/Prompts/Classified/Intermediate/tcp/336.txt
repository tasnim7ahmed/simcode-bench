Generate an NS-3 C++ script to simulate a wired network with TCP communication between two computers. The first computer (Computer 1) sends 10 TCP packets (each 1024 bytes) to the second computer (Computer 2) over a Point-to-Point connection with a data rate of 5 Mbps and a 10 ms delay. The communication takes place on port 9, and the client sends packets at a 1-second interval. Use the IP address range 192.168.1.0/24.
