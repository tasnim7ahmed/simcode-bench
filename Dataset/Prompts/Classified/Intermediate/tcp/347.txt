Generate an NS-3 C++ script to simulate a TCP communication between two nodes. The simulation should include one node acting as a TCP server and the other node acting as a TCP client. The IPv4 protocol should be used for communication. The TCP server should be installed on Node 0, and the TCP client on Node 1. The client should send one 1024-byte packet to the server with a 1-second interval. The simulation should run for 10 seconds, starting the server at 1 second and the client at 2 seconds.
