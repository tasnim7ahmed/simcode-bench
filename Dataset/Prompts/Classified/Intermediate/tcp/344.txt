Generate an NS-3 C++ script to simulate a WiFi network with three nodes. The nodes are statically placed with a grid-based mobility model, and the WiFi devices should use 802.11b. Node 2 should act as a TCP server listening on port 9, while node 0 and node 1 act as TCP clients. Each client sends 10 TCP packets of 512 bytes to the server at intervals of 0.1 seconds. The simulation should run for 20 seconds. The nodes should be arranged in a 3x3 grid layout.
