Generate an NS-3 C++ script to simulate a Wi-Fi network with two nodes. One node acts as a Wi-Fi Access Point (AP), and the other as a client that sends UDP packets to the server. The client should send 100 packets of 512 bytes at a rate of one packet every 0.1 seconds. Use port 9 for communication and run the simulation for 10 seconds. The Wi-Fi network should follow the 802.11b standard with SSID = 'ns3-wifi'.
