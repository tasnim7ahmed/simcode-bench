Create a C++ program using ns-3 that simulates a simple Wi-Fi infrastructure network with two nodes operating on the 802.11b physical layer. One node acts as a station and the other as an access point. The station sends packets to the access point, and the signal strength is controlled by a FixedRssLossModel, independent of the distance between nodes. The user can configure parameters such as RSS, packet size, number of packets, interval between packets, and verbose logging via command-line options. The script should generate PCAP trace files and allow analysis of packet reception based on signal strength.
