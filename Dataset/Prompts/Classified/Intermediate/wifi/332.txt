Generate an NS-3 C++ script to set up a WiFi ad-hoc network with two nodes. The network consists of Node 0 (sender) and Node 1 (receiver). Use 802.11b WiFi standard in ad-hoc mode (no access point). Node 0 sends UDP packets to Node 1 on port 9 starting at 2 seconds and stops at 10 seconds. Node 1 receives UDP packets starting at 1 second and stops at 10 seconds. The packets are sent at an interval of 1 second, with each packet having a size of 1024 bytes, and the sender sends a total of 10 packets.
