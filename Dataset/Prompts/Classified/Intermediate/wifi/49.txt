Generate a complete NS-3 simulation program that models an IEEE 802.11n Wi-Fi network with a non-Wi-Fi interferer. The code should include appropriate NS-3 libraries, setup for spectrum-based and Yans-based Wi-Fi channels, and the ability to handle both TCP and UDP traffic. Implement command-line argument parsing to control simulation parameters such as simulation time, distance between nodes, index values (for MCS, channel width, and guard interval combinations), waveform power, Wi-Fi type, and error model. Provide detailed output regarding transmission rates, throughput, received signal strength, noise, and SNR during the simulation. Ensure proper configuration of node mobility, internet stack, and the installation of Wi-Fi devices. Include support for packet tracing and allow toggling PCAP generation.
