Write a C++ simulation script using NS-3 to test TCP performance over an 802.11n wireless network with MPDU aggregation enabled. The topology consists of one access point (AP) and one station (STA). The STA sends TCP packets to the AP, and the simulation reports the total throughput every 100ms. The simulation should allow for command-line configuration of parameters such as the TCP congestion control algorithm, application data rate, payload size, physical layer bitrate, simulation duration, and whether PCAP tracing is enabled. Use NS-3's YansWifiHelper for configuring the Wi-Fi channel and mobility models.
