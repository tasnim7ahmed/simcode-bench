Generate an NS-3 C++ script to simulate a WiFi network with two nodes communicating over TCP. The nodes should use WiFi 802.11b with a grid-based mobility model where nodes have static positions at (0,0) and (5,10) meters. Set the client node (node 0) to send 100 TCP packets of 512 bytes every 0.1 seconds to the server node (node 1) on port 9. The simulation should run for 20 seconds. Use a WiFi Aarf (adaptive rate) manager for connection management.
