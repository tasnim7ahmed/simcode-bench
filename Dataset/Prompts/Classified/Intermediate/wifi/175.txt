Create an ns-3 simulation that demonstrates a wireless network with Wi-Fi communication between three nodes. One node acts as a Wi-Fi access point (AP), while the other two are Wi-Fi stations (STA) communicating through the AP. The simulation will include the setup of Wi-Fi standards, Internet stack installation, and enable NetAnim visualization to capture the network behavior and packet exchanges.
