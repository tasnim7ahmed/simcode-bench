Create a C++ simulation script using NS-3 to demonstrate how to modify Wi-Fi timing parameters, such as slot time, SIFS, and PIFS, through command-line arguments. The simulation features a simple network topology with an access point (AP) and a station (STA) using 802.11n over a 2.4 GHz channel. The AP runs a UDP client that sends packets to a UDP server on the STA, and the throughput is calculated at the end of the simulation. Implement the required wireless channel, PHY, MAC, mobility, and internet stacks, while adjusting Wi-Fi timing attributes like slot, SIFS, and PIFS dynamically.
