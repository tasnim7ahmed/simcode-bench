Generate a simple NS-3 C++ WiFi network simulation with two nodes. The first node (client) sends TCP packets to the second node (server) over a WiFi link. Use a 1Gbps data rate, assign IPs in the 192.168.1.0/24 range, and ensure the Internet stack is installed. The server should run from 1s to 10s, while the client starts at 2s and sends packets at 0.1s intervals. The simulation should start at 1s and run for 10s.
