Write a program in C++ using the ns-3 network simulator that configures an IEEE 802.11ac Wi-Fi network with options for UDP or TCP traffic, RTS/CTS, 80+80 MHz channel width, different modulation and coding schemes (MCS 0-9), various channel widths (20, 40, 80, 160 MHz), and guard intervals (short or long). The program should simulate a simple network with one station and one access point (STA-AP), allow customization of distance between the nodes, and output the goodput (throughput) for every combination of the parameters. Include necessary ns-3 headers and use appropriate helper classes such as `SpectrumWifiPhy`, `YansWifiPhy`, `UdpClientHelper`, `UdpServerHelper`, `OnOffHelper`, `PacketSinkHelper`, and others to simulate the network and applications.
