Generate an NS-3 C++ script that simulates a Wi-Fi network with one Access Point (AP) and one Station (STA). The AP and STA should be assigned static positions. The STA should send UDP packets to the AP using a UDP Echo Client, and the AP should run a UDP Echo Server to respond. The simulation should use the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet, with the client starting at 2 seconds and stopping at 9 seconds, while the server runs from 1 second to 10 seconds.
