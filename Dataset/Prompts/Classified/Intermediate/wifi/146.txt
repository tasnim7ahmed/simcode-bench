Write a simple C++ program using the ns-3 simulation library to set up a mesh topology with four nodes. Configure the nodes to communicate using a Wi-Fi mesh network, assign them static positions in a 2x2 grid layout, and use UDP traffic to generate communication between the nodes. The simulation should run for 15 seconds, and basic statistics such as packet transmission and reception should be recorded. Additionally, enable PCAP tracing to capture the packet flow for analysis.
